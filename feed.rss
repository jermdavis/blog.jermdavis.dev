			<title>Customising Statiq's generated sitemap</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/extend-statiq-sitemap</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed the other week that the sitemap file my blog was generating included the urls, but none of the other metadata that they can report. To be honest, I'm not sure if search engines pay much attention to this these days, but since the &lt;a href="https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;schema for the files includes other options&lt;/a&gt; I decided to see if I could add them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Fixing a broken preview database</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/sitecore-preview-database-crash</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A colleague pointed me at an interesting issue recently, where trying to switch the Sitecore Desktop to view a &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot; database for a Publishing Target on a client's website caused a crash. The reason for this appears to be an interesting issue it would be fairly easy for others to trip over, so this seemed a useful thing to write up:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Debugging the depths of MSBuild</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/debugging-msbuild-tools-approaches</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I found myself looking at a Visual Studio project where the build was not behaving in the way I expected. So I was forced to try a few debugging techniques to work out what was up. And in the process of trying to resolve the problem, I discovered an interesting tool to help with scenarios like this. So if you find yourself stuck with a misbehaving MSBuild script here are a couple of ideas:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Using the htmx framework with Sitecore MVC</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/using-htmx-with-sitecore-mvc</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I'm not much of a front-end person. While I can do JavaScript and CSS if I need to, I tend to have to spend quite a bit of time in Google remembering all the key facts. But every so often I find myself needing to do some client-side code, so anything that can make that job easier seems like an interesting idea. Recently I came across the &lt;a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;htmx framework&lt;/a&gt; - which offers a way to do common AJAX-like dynamic front-end tasks with little ceremony, and pretty much zero JavaScript. So I figured I should have a hack about and see if it's of any use with the sort of &amp;quot;traditional&amp;quot; Sitecore I'm confident with...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What do you mean there are no AppDomains in modern .Net?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/app-domains-modern-dotnet</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was looking at writing a tool in .Net 7 the other day which would benefit from having an option to load and unload plugin extensions. Reloadable plugins could be a bit tricky in .Net 4, but doable. But that's changed dramatically in more recent framework versions, in some ways that are better and interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Sitecore, time zones and containers</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/sitecore-container-timezone</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;To customise &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a very old joke&lt;/a&gt;, there are only two difficult issues in IT: Naming things, Time calculations&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; and off-by-one errors. And adding containers into the mix raises even more fun. I recently hit an issue where containerised Sitecore needed to use a different time zone to the physical servers it was hosted on. So what can be done to configure this? Here's two things that can help:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Does Bing dislike Cloudflare?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/bing-vs-cloudflare</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I started migrating my writings off WordPress and over to this GitHub Pages site towards the end of 2021. And since I've done that I've not been able to get any search coverage of this site in Bing. But suddenly it seems to be starting to work. And it's looking like it might be related to CloudFlare...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Some fun migrating a T4 Template to a Source Generator</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/migrating-t4-to-source-generators</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;My recent post about &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/inheritance-bug-static-methods" target="_blank"&gt;messing up with inheritance&lt;/a&gt; came out of some work to migrate some (fairly old) T4 Template code generation to .Net's newer Source Generators feature. Excluding my own mistakes, this process wasn't as easy as I'd hoped. So it seemed like a good topic to jot some notes down about, in case others are facing similar challenges...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Adding build metadata to your .Net code</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/build-metadata-dotnet</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I had a scenario where I wanted to be able to display the date an app was built in its UI. While you can always fall back to a &amp;quot;just make that a string in your code&amp;quot; approach, after a bit of digging I discovered a better way. It turns out recent .Net code has some clever patterns to help with this...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Getting tweets (and toots) as images for my blog</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/rendering-tweets</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Since the whole &amp;quot;Twitter's in something of a downward spiral&amp;quot; thing kicked off, I'd been musing over the idea that having embedded tweets in my blog might not be such a good thing long term. What happens if the mad billionaire at the helm suddenly decides that embedding tweets should be a paid feature, or the site has a long outage? The best alternative I had was to turn the tweets into images - so obviously I investigated how I could automate this. Turns out it was a fun feature to add to my blog editor...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
