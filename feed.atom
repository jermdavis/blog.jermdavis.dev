		<content>&lt;p&gt;Some of the most frustrating issues in IT happen when a thing which was working fine stops, and you're sure you didn't change anything. Now that very few people host their own infrastructure, these issues can be compounded because change or problems might happen in the internals of a system you have no control over. I got bitten by this recently, and while I have no answers I suspect this is worth writing up just because it may help other people who suffer similar challenges in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

With code to load a browser, and the overarching State Machine to control it, this part finishes off with the code for some states to load a page and extract its markup.

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I bumped into an issue recently where I needed to write some code to scrape a bit of HTML. The usual .Net approach of using an &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; didn't work here - the web site in question made use of some &amp;quot;bot detection&amp;quot; code which relied on requests running JavaScript to validate them. So I needed a different approach to fetch the correct HTML. A while back I'd written some code to &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/rendering-tweets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grab images of rendered HTML using the Chromium DevTools APIs&lt;/a&gt;, and I figured I could play a similar game here...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;When I started this blog nearly a decade ago, it was with the goal to see if I could motivate myself to write something about technical stuff on a regular basis. I certainly did not expect that I'd still be doing it 300 posts later. So in honour of that milestone I thought I'd look back at what's gone well here, a bit of what hasn't and how the technical world I'm writing for has changed since then...&lt;/p&gt;</content>
