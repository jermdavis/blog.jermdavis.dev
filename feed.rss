			<title>Blank white screen from local XM Cloud Rendering host?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/xmcloud-white-screen-rendering-certificates</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are some days when technology just doesn't want to play ball. And in my experience 99% of these days are when you're on a developer training course and its the exercise/labs machine that's being difficult. I had this recently on the XM Cloud developer intro course. I've no idea if anyone else would ever see this issue (or how it was caused) but it didn't return much useful info in Google, and I did find a way to fix for my problem. So it's documentation time...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Expiring links I know will go bad over time</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/expiring-outdated-blog-links</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It struck me recently that there are a few places in this blog where I linked to pages I know will disappear over time. The examples that started me thinking about this were the Symposium and SUGCON websites that get published each year. They tend to reuse the same domain names from year to year without archiving the old content. So those links go stale fairly quickly, and posts from years back now point to this year's events by default. So I started wondering if I could fix this issue automatically...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>How SecurityDisabler and similar 'switcher' objects work in Sitecore</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/how-security-disabler-works</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just because stuff is &amp;quot;old&amp;quot; doesn't mean it's not interesting... I found myself having a discussion with a colleague recently about the state management patterns that Sitecore uses for things like &lt;code&gt;SecurityDisabler&lt;/code&gt; and how they work in the ASP.Net pipeline. It's not new tech, but it is an interesting pattern which you might find uses for outside your XP implementations...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What's this Accelerate business?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/what-and-why-of-accelerate</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other week I got the chance to do a talk for the Manchester user group in the UK about the what &amp;amp; why of Sitecore's Accelerate program. It seemed like a topic that was worth summarising here as well, for people who prefer to read their info rather than watch it...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Looking forward to SUGCON EU</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/looking-forward-sugcon-eu</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I got my first chance to take a look at the agenda for this year's &lt;a href="https://europe.sugcon.events/" until="2024/04/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SUGCON EU&lt;/a&gt; (in Dublin next month), and a few things jumped out for me as things I probably want to watch at the event. Maybe they'd be of interest to you too?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Confusing myself with Sitecore's database authentication</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things you think you know turn out not to be right. I got bitten by this issue recently, and it seemed like something to write down. Because being wrong is fine, as long as you learn something...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>When not to follow 'the rules'...</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/not-following-the-rules</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are certain &amp;quot;rules of programming&amp;quot; that I keep hearing about in my career. One that came up in an interesting work debate recently was &amp;quot;you should never use regular expressions to parse HTML&amp;quot;. Don't get me wrong - there can be a lot of useful knowledge wrapped up in these rules, but should we &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; follow them to the letter? I think it's an interesting question...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A fun gotcha with Azure Front Door Premium</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/azure-front-door-redirect-loop</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I bumped into an interesting redirect-loop issue with a Sitecore instance sitting behind Azure Front Door recently. It's not a product I know a great deal about, so this seemed worth writing down in case I come across it again, or others bump into the same challenge. Turns out it wasn't a Sitecore-specific issue, but its definitely something which could affect other Sitecore sites...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>XM Cloud: We're on a journey</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2024/xm-cloud-futures</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of interesting discussion at SUGCON NA and the MVP Summit towards the back-end of last year. I've got piles of notes I took about stuff that caught my attention over the course of those events. But out of all the sessions, one specific thing stuck out to me as a vision of our future as Sitecore developers. And it's a topic that's come up a few times in my conversations with people at work and in the general community. So it seemed like it was worth writing about...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Adding reading time estimates to blog posts</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/reading-time-estimates-statiq</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The second idea on my &amp;quot;little things I'd meant to add to this blog for a while&amp;quot; list was reading time estimates. Like &lt;a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the reading progress indicator from before&lt;/a&gt;, this shouldn't be tricky, and in this case I wanted to write it down in case anyone else working with &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Statiq&lt;/a&gt; was interested in achieving something similar on their site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
