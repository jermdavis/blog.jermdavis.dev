		<content>&lt;p&gt;I quite often clone Sitecore's Docker Examples repo and spin up a Sitecore instance to experiment with. It's a quick way to create a disposable site which I can easily configure and deploy little bits of test code to. But recently I did this and noticed some odd warnings. So here's what happened and why, to help you avoid the same issue...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I was having a chat recently about alternatives to &lt;a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; if you needed to send HTTP requests to arbitrary web endpoints. I mentioned using Visual Studio's support for &lt;code&gt;.http&lt;/code&gt; files for this during that discussion, and then found myself trying it out for some work too. But it seems there's a couple of tricky little bugs hiding in here, which tripped me up when I tried to set up a call to one of Sitecore's XM Cloud GraphQL endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;As developers we often need to move data between SQL Server instances. Some of the time database backups are fine for this, because you want to move everything. But on occasion what you need is a SQL script which can insert some rows of data you had on another server for you. And when I find myself needing this feature, I also find myself having to google how to do it. So to help my memory, here's how to generate scripts for your data:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This is a pure static site, hosted on Github Pages, so there's no Solr or Algolia here. Just some clever JavaScript (&lt;a href="https://lunr.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lunr.js&lt;/a&gt;) acting on data generated by &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Statiq&lt;/a&gt;.

Both the site generator I'm using these days, and the simple editor tool I hacked together to suit my writing process. I realised recently that one of those rough edges that remained in the process was the need to manually commit my writing to source control, so I wondered what it might take to wire that into my editing tool...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

While that worked for me, and I was able to get it to do what I needed, I was never really happy with all the output source as literal strings in the generator code.

		<content>&lt;p&gt;A very long time ago I managed a server with some websites on it. So long ago, in fact, that this &amp;quot;cutting edge&amp;quot; deployment was on Windows 2000 Server. I made a virtual machine backup of this server at the time, burned the files onto a DVD and filed this away in case I ever needed it. And recently I had reason to want some data off this ancient machine. I was able to get it fired up, but it took a little effort to get there. It feels like a minor miracle that I was able to make this run, so I wanted to write down some of the things I messed about with - partly so I'll remember if I ever have to do something similar again, and partly because this might be of interest to (a small number of) others too...&lt;/p&gt;</content>
