		<content>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, I got my first chance to take a look at the agenda for this year's &lt;a href="https://europe.sugcon.events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SUGCON EU&lt;/a&gt; (in Dublin next month), and a few things jumped out for me as things I probably want to watch at the event. Maybe they'd be of interest to you too?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;There are certain &amp;quot;rules of programming&amp;quot; that I keep hearing about in my career. One that came up in an interesting work debate recently was &amp;quot;you should never use regular expressions to parse HTML&amp;quot;. Don't get me wrong - there can be a lot of useful knowledge wrapped up in these rules, but should we &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; follow them to the letter?

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I bumped into an interesting redirect-loop issue with a Sitecore instance sitting behind Azure Front Door recently. It's not a product I know a great deal about, so this seemed worth writing down in case I come across it again, or others bump into the same challenge. Turns out it wasn't a Sitecore-specific issue, but its definitely something which could affect other Sitecore sites...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of interesting discussion at SUGCON NA and the MVP Summit towards the back-end of last year. I've got piles of notes I took about stuff that caught my attention over the course of those events. But out of all the sessions, one specific thing stuck out to me as a vision of our future as Sitecore developers. And it's a topic that's come up a few times in my conversations with people at work and in the general community. So it seemed like it was worth writing about...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

Like &lt;a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the reading progress indicator from before&lt;/a&gt;, this shouldn't be tricky, and in this case I wanted to write it down in case anyone else working with &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Statiq&lt;/a&gt; was interested in achieving something similar on their site.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I bumped into an issue recently where I needed to write some code to scrape a bit of HTML. The usual .Net approach of using an &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; didn't work here - the web site in question made use of some client-side JavaScript to generate mark-up at runtime. So I needed a different approach to fetch the resulting HTML. A while back I'd written some code to &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/rendering-tweets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grab images of rendered HTML using the Chromium DevTools APIs&lt;/a&gt;, and I figured I could play a similar game here...&lt;/p&gt;</content>
