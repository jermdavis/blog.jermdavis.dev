					<h2 id="the-issue">The issue</h2>
					<p>I've been working on a client project that was adopted from another agency. We'd been through an onboarding process where we'd taken over the source and the release process in Azure DevOps. The project was hosted in the client's Azure, and they maintained control of that. The build and release pipelines for this work ran on Azure VMs the client hosted, rather than on Microsoft's cloud agents. We'd done some successfull releases of the code to the test and production infrastructure after taking over. There had been a few issues along the way, but broadly the process appeared to be working.</p>
					<p>We'd done a release of some new changes to the UAT infrastructure, and having got that signed off, we tried to run the same release on production. And this failed in an entirely unexpected way...</p>
					<p>The release process goes through a fairly common pattern:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The appropriate AppServices get backed up</li>
						<li>The staging slots for the AppServices are prepared</li>
						<li>The project code is deployed</li>
						<li>Tests are done</li>
						<li>The staging slots are swapped with the production slots</li>
					</ul>
					<p>In the middle of the "project code is deployed" step, the release pipeline uses WebDeploy to push assorted packages of code onto the target AppServices. And in this case, that step was failing. It was deploying some packages ok, one was failing, and then it deployed the rest successfully. The error we saw looked like this:</p>
					<p>
						<a target="_blank" href="/img/2023/08-FailedWebDeploy.png">
							<img alt="An error from the Azure DevOps release pipeline saying ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE for one of a number of WebDeploy packages" src="/img/2023/08-FailedWebDeploy.png">
						</a>
					</p>
					<p>For Google's benefit, the error message is:</p>
					<pre class="code" data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;">2023-07-24T08:19:54.0960901Z ##[error]Error Code: ERROR_DESTINATION_NOT_REACHABLE
2023-07-24T08:19:54.1054292Z ##[error]More Information: Could not connect to the remote computer ("REDACTED-cm-staging.scm.azurewebsites.net"). On the remote computer, make sure that Web Deploy is installed and that the required process ("Web Management Service") is started.

2023-07-24T08:19:54.1146052Z ##[error]Error: Unable to connect to the remote server

2023-07-24T08:19:54.1237674Z ##[error]Error: A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time, or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond REDACTED:443

2023-07-24T08:19:54.1329763Z ##[error]Error count: 1.

					</pre>
					<p>The fact that a number of packages succeeded, then this one failed, and then more succeeded during this step was very odd. That suggested some sort of transient error. So we tried repeating the release step. And it failed again - but with an error on a different package in the set.</p>
					<p>We tried it a few times, and found that it failed reliably, but on a different package (or packages plural in some cases) each time.</p>
					<p>So we aborted the release, apologised to the client for the delay, and went back to the UAT site to test further. And attempts to release to UAT failed too - with similar errors...</p>
					<h2 id="further-investigations">Further investigations</h2>
					<p>A developer's first instinct at this point is to go look at Google. And searching for issues with these errors around WebDeploy packages brings up a lot of people talking about how disabling "SCM" fixed issues for them. None of the posts matched the error we saw exactly, but the phrase "On the remote computer, make sure that Web Deploy is installed and that the required process ("Web Management Service") is started." popped up a lot.</p>
					<p>The supposed fix here was relatively simple: In the AppService's configuration settings, add a new entry to set
						<code>WEBSITE_WEBDEPLOY_USE_SCM</code>
						to
						<code>false</code>
						on the AppService and its slots.</p>
					<p>So we tried that, and it broke things in an exciting new way. Now the backups for the AppService stopped working. They would start, and wait for a while before failing with a broad
						<code>##[error]An error occurred while sending the request.</code>
						message in the DevOps log. In the AppService Activity Log, a slightly more useful error was shown in the JSON version of the log data:</p>
					<pre class="code" data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;">Timestamp: 2023-07-28T11:36:13.9557166Z\r\nCreating temp folder.

Error in the backup operation: Storage access failed. The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.. Please delete and recreate backup schedule to mitigate."

					</pre>
					<p>But it's still not a useful answer - there's no scheduled job to recreate here...</p>
					<p>Since we had backups from before the issue started, we tried skipping the backup steps on the next test release to UAT. And this raised yet another error message:</p>
					<pre class="code" data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;">2023-07-26T15:18:55.2097709Z ##[error]Error: Error Code: ERROR_USER_UNAUTHORIZED
More Information: Connected to the remote computer (REDACTED.publish.azurewebsites.windows.net") using the Web Management Service, but could not authorize. Make sure that you are using the correct user name and password, that the site you are connecting to exists, and that the credentials represent a user who has permissions to access the site.  Learn more at: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=221672#ERROR_USER_UNAUTHORIZED.
Error: The remote server returned an error: (401) Unauthorized.
Error count: 1.

					</pre>
					<p>Here, trying to use WebDeploy to send a package to the AppService is being blocked for security reasons. But that seemed like an odd error. This whole process was running under a Service Principal that had successfully deployed before.</p>
					<p>After trying to verify the credentials, and proving that they did indeed have rights to all the relevant things, we concluded that this "disable SCM" fix was not right for this scenario. Rolling it back got rid of these backup and authorisation errors, and put us back to the original problem.</p>
					<h2 id="an-unhelpful-solution">An unhelpful solution</h2>
					<p>So we spent quite a bit of time talking to the client and trying to veryify that nobody had changed anything. And in parallel we raised a support ticket with Microsoft, and had a triage call with them where we demonstrated the issue. They didn't give us specific answers, but said they would raise the issue with their AppService experts...</p>
					<p>While we waited, we got briefly distracted by the whole "<a href="https://support.sitecore.com/kb?id=kb_article_view&amp;sysparm_article=KB1002999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myget has vanished</a>" issue which hit a lot of Sitecore developers, and then went back to some tests.</p>
					<p>And this time it worked fine.</p>
					<p>At some point after involving Microsoft Support, the issue magically disappeared. This happened to coincide with there being an outage of Azure DevOps build pipelines in some EU regions, which the support people say "is related" though that seems an odd cause for our self-hosted release pipeline to break.</p>
					<p>But sometimes you don't get an answer...</p>
