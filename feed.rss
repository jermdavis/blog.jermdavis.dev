			<title>Coding against an OrderCloud sandbox</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2026/ordercloud-client-sandbox</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;If you're experimenting with OrderCloud then getting a sandbox instance is an important part of the discovery process. Unlike most of Sitecore's products, this one is available free to anyone (just &lt;a href="https://portal.ordercloud.io/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;register in the portal&lt;/a&gt;) - so it's easy to give it a try. But if you want to build an experiment against the sandbox instance you need your code to authenticate with it. And this has tripped me up a couple of times because it's not wildly well documented. So learn from my frustration...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>SUGCON's coming! Have you booked yet?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2026/coming-up-at-sugcon</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Have you thought about attending SUGCON EU this year? We're getting close to the community's big annual get-together which is being held in London this year. And as ever it has a very interesting looking agenda. Still thinking whether you should attend? Here's a few of the reasons why I'll be there... &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Nerding out about covariance and immutability</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2026/nerding-covariance-immutability</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been working with C# most of my career, but every so often they add bits to the language which for some reason I've never really got to make use of. And &amp;quot;covariance&amp;quot; is one of those things. But I picked up a beta copy of a great new book recently (Eric Lippert's &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.manning.com/books/fabulous-adventures-in-data-structures-and-algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Fabulous Adventures in Data Structures and Algorithms&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from Manning) and it had a simple but fascinating example of a situation where this can work. It taught me something that maybe you might find interesting too...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Two bits of trivia: Content Types and images in Content Hub</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2026/content-hub-trivia</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been looking at some work related to Content Types in Content Hub recently, and while this is a bit like Data Templates in the good old DXP, I had a couple of things I had to spend time researching as part of this work. So maybe if you're looking at using the CMP features, this might help you understand a couple of quirks too... &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Following on from the general framework bits in the previous posts about building a text adventure, what needs doing to create an example game? Here's an explanation of the example repo game to show how it all goes together.

			<title>Text adventures: Behaviours for flavour</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/textadventure-behaviour</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Last time up we created the very basics of a text adventure where we could look at rooms in the world, and had a way to provide other commands like movement or picking stuff up. So what can we do to let the world react to the user's actions, and create puzzles and atmosphere for a game? Step forward behaviours...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Text adventures: The player's commands</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/textadventure-commands</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The world model from the previous post is all well and good, but the player needs to be able to interact with it. What do we need to add to allow that? Well we need an abstraction for the things the game is going to allow the player to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What a busy Symposium!</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had a few days to decompress and think about all the stuff I heard from the various stages at this year's Sitecore Symposium in Orlando. So here's a rundown of the key messages for me, from my viewpoint as a developer and architect in the Sitecore space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Text adventures: Starting with a world</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/textadventure-world</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from someone who's been writing a blog for a decade, text adventures were something I really liked back in the day. I spent a lot of time on classic Infocom games like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. But what if you wanted to build your own as a .Net developer? This blog series has some suggestions...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Four things to remember about Sitecore Search</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/remember-about-search</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who's been doing Sitecore DXP for a while will be fairly comfortable with Solr and how search works under the Content Search APIs. But if you're moving to the newer SaaS products then you're not working with that any more. And getting started with Sitecore's SaaS Search product does involve learning a few changed concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four quick things they tell you that you might not have thought too much about, but you need to remember to help avoid project surprises...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
