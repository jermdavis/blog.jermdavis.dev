		<content>&lt;p&gt;If you're part of the Sitecore Partner or MVP community then you probably watched some of the content from their &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tzikakis/status/1546854414937374720" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Global Sales Kick-off&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; recently. They talked about product roadmap and strategy stuff for the coming year, especially the new &lt;a href="https://www.sitecore.com/company/news-events/press-releases/2022/07/sitecore-experience-manager-cloud-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;XM Cloud&lt;/a&gt; product. But something else which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daveof" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dave O'Flanagan&lt;/a&gt; called out in his session is of interest to us in the community too: Sitecore's new internal demo portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to spin up a demo instance of Sitecore has been a common challenge for me over the time I've worked with the product. There have been various ways to do this - some very manual, and some involving a bit more automation. Different organisations and people all had their own approaches to how best to do this - but it's now being looked at centrally. I was lucky enough to get a sneak-peak of their new approach to this problem. And now it's been launched it seemed like something worth writing up, to make more Partners and MVPs aware of the tools at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;One of the recurring themes of deploying Sitecore over the last few years has been &amp;quot;how do I deal with Solr?&amp;quot;. It's a question with many valid answers... I've been doing some research for a client recently, because they wanted to run their own SolrCloud instances in Kubernetes - and I came across the Apache Foundation's &amp;quot;Solr Operator&amp;quot; project. It's an interesting shortcut to efficient containerised deployments of Solr, and it might help you too...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

While they do have a bit of a reputation for making people's lives worse (&lt;a href="http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;so much there's a well known programmer joke about it&lt;/a&gt;) they do have a place in your developer toolbox. So what caught my eye in the new features, and how does code get better with this new version? &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I hit a rather confusing issue with a release a while back, which initially appeared to be a Unicorn problem. But after investigating the details, I think this was actually an infrastructure problem causing some odd behaviour. I doubt this is a common problem, but still worth writing down in case it's a challenge for anyone else... &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Recently I needed to do an odd bit of printing. I needed to generate an A3 PDF for printing which had crop marks around it. That means it needs to be printed to &amp;quot;a bit larger than A3&amp;quot; size. In the past I'd used Foxit's PDF printer for this (where it just worked), but that no longer seems to be free. Turns out the default Windows PDF printer needs a bit of hackery to enable using odd-sized paper. I'm sure I'll find myself needing to do this again in the future, so this is a reminder for my future self.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
