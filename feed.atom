Like &lt;a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the reading progress indicator from before&lt;/a&gt;, this shouldn't be tricky, and in this case I wanted to write it down in case anyone else working with &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Statiq&lt;/a&gt; was interested in achieving something similar on their site.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I bumped into an issue recently where I needed to write some code to scrape a bit of HTML. The usual .Net approach of using an &lt;code&gt;HttpClient&lt;/code&gt; didn't work here - the web site in question made use of some client-side JavaScript to generate mark-up at runtime. So I needed a different approach to fetch the resulting HTML. A while back I'd written some code to &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2023/rendering-tweets" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;grab images of rendered HTML using the Chromium DevTools APIs&lt;/a&gt;, and I figured I could play a similar game here...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;There aren't that many places where RSS gets used these days (Shame! It's still good!), but that doesn't stop the occasional requirement for it coming up in projects. Recently I was having some discussions about how a client's site could offer RSS for their content which included custom UTM codes in the feed links. That's not too tricky to achieve with Sitecore, so here's an example of what you might do.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

One of the fun points of changing the approach to your deployments is that sometimes you have to look differently at how some core configuration issues too. And this seems like an issue others will encounter too:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Some time back I did a load of work on performance diagnostic work on some poorly performing Sitecore websites. (Which was the basis of &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2017/measure-if-you-want-to-go-faster" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a talk I gave a few times&lt;/a&gt;) I've recently had to look at some similar issues - but the world has moved on. I now have Visual Studio 2022 as my diagnostic tool of choice, and the websites are commonly hosted in Azure PaaS web apps. So what do you have to do these days to diagnose likely places for your code to be stuck? &lt;/p&gt;</content>
