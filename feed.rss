			<title>Docker Desktop v4.14 or v4.15 breaks Windows Containers?</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The other day my copy of Docker Desktop on two different work laptops prompted me to update. And neither would work properly after the update completed. In case this issue is affecting others, here's the saga of what I saw and two ways it can be fixed:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Webhooks in Sitecore 10.3</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/sitecore-10-3-webhooks-integration</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;After a bit more of a pause than most attendees of &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/symposium-2022#your-on-prem-paas-dxp-gets-some-love-too" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Symposium&lt;/a&gt; this year were expecting, &lt;a href="https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/103/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_103.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sitecore 10.3 is finally out in the wild now&lt;/a&gt;. And (to me at least) one of the most interesting changes is that the server-side event model for the CMS has been extended with Webhooks. What does that mean, and how can you make use of them? Well since I was lucky enough to get my hands on the "MVP Preview" of this release a couple of weeks back, I've had a chance to do some digging. Read on to find out...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Discovering C# exception filters</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/csharp-catch-when-contextual-exception-filter</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;There's been a lot going on with language development in C# over the last couple of years. But despite all the current change for things like &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;record&lt;/a&gt; types and &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/preview-features-in-net-6-generic-math/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;generic maths&lt;/a&gt;, there are some changes from older versions that I somehow missed. This week social media put me on to the concept of contextual filters for exception handling. What's that? Read on...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What happened to my Insert Options?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/missing-insert-options</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I had a moment of confusion with broken Insert Options recently, which made me wonder whether I ever knew the answer behind the issue or whether I'd just forgotten it over the many years I've been working with this CMS. Either way, this needs writing down to help me remember it in the future...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Key points from Symposium 2022</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/symposium-2022</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Having been in Chicago for the last week to attend &lt;a href="https://symposium.sitecore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Symposium&lt;/a&gt; and the MVP summit, I now have a notebook full of interesting observations. While some of that is under NDA and hence all &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Squirrel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Secret Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;, there were a collection of important public announcements which I can report. The key product and technical take-aways from the conferece are pretty important for customers and partners. So here's my summary: &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Can I have trackbacks on my static blog?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/static-blog-trackbacks</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the side-effects of being pretty old, and having been around The Internet for some time is that every so often I get to be the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Old Man Shouting at Clouds&lt;/a&gt; over things I think went wrong along the way.

			<title>Strange Docker / Zookeeper errors</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/docker-zookeeper-solr-fail</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Usually with these blog posts, I find a problem, I fight with it for a bit, and then I solve the problem. But this post has been sitting half-written in my publishing queue since May (!) this year, and I have entirely failed to solve this issue. So I'm admitting defeat, and publishing this anyway because maybe one of you knows the answer. Or at least it might serve as a warning...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue is that I've been working through some really odd and annoying Solr issues which only manifest in Docker on one laptop. I'm really not sure if these are issues that others might see, or if this is a problem that's entirely down to this laptop's setup. But they're definitely a problem... &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Hosting ASP.Net Core 7 Preview 7 under IIS</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/dot-net-7-on-iis</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was hacking up an app as a personal project recently, and decided to try out the latest preview (Number 7) of ASP.Net Core for .Net 7. I happened to be deploying this project to a server which had never run ASP.Net Core before, and that deployment left me scratching my head for some time. So in case this issue hits others, here's what happened to me:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Where is Solr living these days?</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/where-is-solr-living</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;One thing we don't seem to be short of these days is options for deploying Solr. I've had to do a bit of thinking about this recently, as I draw up plans for a work project. So I figured I'd write a bit of it down because if I'm having to explain it to people, then chances are there are plenty of others out there in Internet Land who are finding themselves having to think about these issues too: &lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Planning for Symposium 2022</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/planning-symposium-2022</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For me at least, Symposium is going to be very interesting this year. The move to composable, the first big public event discussing the reality of XM Cloud and the new Sitecore Search product will all generate a lot of interesting content. Plus, with this being the first in-person event since the whole COVID business, I'm expecting quite a buzz this year. Since the first version of the agenda for the sessions was published last week, I've been doing a bit of thinking about what I want to watch in amongst all the great content. So here are some thoughts on the key breakout sessions I'd like to attend. Other than the one that I'm presenting, of course...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
