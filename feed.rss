			<title>Text adventures: The player's commands</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/textadventure-commands</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;The world model from the previous post is all well and good, but the player needs to be able to interact with it. What do we need to add to allow that? Well we need an abstraction for the things the game is going to allow the player to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>What a busy Symposium!</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/busy-symposium-highlights</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've had a few days to decompress and think about all the stuff I heard from the various stages at this year's Sitecore Symposium in Orlando. So here's a rundown of the key messages for me, from my viewpoint as a developer and architect in the Sitecore space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Text adventures: Starting with a world</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/textadventure-world</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from someone who's been writing a blog for a decade, text adventures were something I really liked back in the day. I spent a lot of time on classic Infocom games like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;. But what if you wanted to build your own as a .Net developer? This blog series has some suggestions...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Four things to remember about Sitecore Search</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/remember-about-search</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who's been doing Sitecore DXP for a while will be fairly comfortable with Solr and how search works under the Content Search APIs. But if you're moving to the newer SaaS products then you're not working with that any more. And getting started with Sitecore's SaaS Search product does involve learning a few changed concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four quick things they tell you that you might not have thought too much about, but you need to remember to help avoid project surprises...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>C# is fixing a thing that irritated me!</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/new-extensions-csharp</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time a small thing in writing Razor code for Sitecore (and in some other places) has irritated me. It's not really very important, but with the new version of C# there is finally a way to round off this rough edge that's been getting to me...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Messing up your page layout with a fun Razor mistake</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/messing-up-razor</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it's the simplest things that can trip up development work. A case in point is a bug ticket I got handed recently, which I think shows the need to understand your tools when writing code. Read on to avoid an interesting mistake with code flow in Razor views...&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Fun with Radio Buttons in Sitecore's SaaS forms</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/radio-buttons-saas-forms</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I was doing some investigation into moving some Experience Forms UI over to the new SaaS Forms in XM Cloud recently, and bumped into an interesting issue. If you're looking to make use of this new tool you may find this an interesting read:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>Disk permissions with cloud AD</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/disk-permissions-icacls</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, work moved from having a traditional domain-joined laptops and an on-site Domain Controller for our Active Directory to the more modern SaaS model of cloud domain. Mostly this doesn't matter at all to employees as they work. But I bumped into one place where I do need to do something different because of this: setting explict disk permissions. So as a reminder to myself for next time, here's how to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<title>A mistake to avoid with Statiq's pipelines</title>
			<link>https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2025/mistake-satiq-pipelines</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I've been tinkering with some pipeline modules for the Statiq generation engine that I use to render this blog, and I bumped into a fun mistake in my code which confused me for a while. To help me next time I'm doing this sort of modification, this seemed worth documenting - even if it is a bit of a silly mistake...&lt;/p&gt;</description>
