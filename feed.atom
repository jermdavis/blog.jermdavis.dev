		<content>&lt;p&gt;I updated the build project for this blog recently, as &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the engine used to generate&lt;/a&gt; it was updated. But doing that caused an issue which I think others might bump into. So here's an explanation of what I saw and how to fix it:&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-issue"&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a couple of places in the theme for my blog I make use of &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt; links. That's a way of writing a link in your source which doesn't directly care where the resulting page will end up. The publishing code will fix-up your link to the correct URL once it's worked out where the target page is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One place I'm using these links is in the MVP widget on the right hand column. Clicking the image takes you to the relevant page. So in the &lt;code&gt;cshtml&lt;/code&gt; for the right column I have a link which says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="html" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;&amp;lt;a href="xref:mvp"&amp;gt;....&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then elsewhere in the project I have a file called &lt;code&gt;mvp.md&lt;/code&gt; which defines that page. And that linking had been working fine up until I updated to beta 45. Having done that, I started to see errors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-ErrorsFromStatiqBuild.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="A list of errors about xref resolution" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-ErrorsFromStatiqBuild.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's basically one error here, but it's repeated a lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;[ERRO] Archives/PostProcess » ExecuteSwitch » RenderContentPostProcessTemplates » ResolveXrefs » 15 xref resolution failures:
C:/Users/jeremy.davis/source/repos/blog.jermdavis.dev/StatiqGenerator/theme/input/posts.cshtml
 - Multiple ambiguous matching documents found for xref "mvp"
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every time the engine is trying to render any page which has the xref link to the mvp page, it gets this error. Something that changed in beta 45 means it can no longer resolve this link correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="working-out-the-cause"&gt;Working out the cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best place to start with an issue like this is with &lt;a href="https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.45" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the release notes for the new version&lt;/a&gt;. And looking through that, there is something interesting here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;Expanded xref lookup behavior to look in all relevant pipelines, not just the "content" pipeline 
(exclusions can be customized using the XrefPipelines and AdditionalXrefPipelines settings).
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking through the git commits associated with this release, and thinking about that comment &lt;a href="https://github.com/statiqdev/Statiq.Web/blob/4c23f91bf2b7a1e4a91ec6c45ff22ef808f9d112/src/Statiq.Web/Bootstrapper/BootstrapperExtensions.cs#L158" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lead me to this extension method&lt;/a&gt;: (with some less relevant bits snipped out)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;private static TBootstrapper AddDefaultWebSettings&amp;lt;TBootstrapper&amp;gt;(this TBootstrapper bootstrapper)
            where TBootstrapper : IBootstrapper =&amp;gt;
            bootstrapper
                .AddSettingsIfNonExisting(new Dictionary&amp;lt;string, object&amp;gt;
                {
                    {
                        WebKeys.XrefPipelines,
                        new string[]
                        {
                            nameof(Pipelines.Content),
                            nameof(Pipelines.Assets),
                            nameof(Pipelines.Data),
                            nameof(Pipelines.Archives),
                            nameof(Pipelines.Feeds)
                        }
                    }
                });
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is providing the value for a config setting as part of the bootstrap process for the Statiq engine. It's specifying a set of pipelines which are going to be processed to find potential &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt; targets. I think in the previous version of the code it only looked at the Content pipeline, but now it looks at all the main ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why might this break my site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to work this out. I tried a variety of changes to my theme and content before I realised what was up. But the answer turned out to be my tags. As well as having a markdown page titled "MVP" in the content, I also had a few posts which were tagged "MVP" too. The Archives pipeline generates pages for each tag to list all the posts which have that tag applied. So you end up with HTML files for both the MVP page and for the MVP tag listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now that the outputs of the Archives pipeline are being considered as possible targets for an &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt; link because of the code changes in this version. And so we have an issue - because as the error says, the code can no longer decide which of the two possible matches is the right one...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="possible-answers"&gt;Possible answers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came up with ideas for how this might get sorted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Option 1 - change the content:&lt;/b&gt; Change the name of the MVP page, or the MVP tag.&lt;br&gt;
Whatever they're called, as long as they both have different names, the problem will go away. Of course you'll have to remember not to accidentally cause the same issue again in the future with some other page/tag combination. So any matching combination will cause the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Option 2 - change the config:&lt;/b&gt; Reconfigure the site to ignore the Archives pipeline.&lt;br&gt;
Alternatively, do you want the xref processing to look at the output of the Archives pipeline? The config in the code above is a setting - which means it can be overridden in the Statiq config files. (Or in your code, if you're choosing to configure things that way) For example I tried adding the following to &lt;code&gt;appsettings.json&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="json" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;{
  "XrefPipelines": ["Content", "Assets", "Data", "Feeds"]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That specifies all of the pipelines except the Archives one - so the output file generated for the "MVP" tag will never be considered as a target of my &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;. The down side of this is that once you exclude the archive pipeline from this config, you can't use an &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt; to refer to anything in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Option 3 - change the links:&lt;/b&gt; Make your links without &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
You could go back to using normal HTML links instead of &lt;code&gt;xref&lt;/code&gt;. That would work fine - but it's sort of avoiding the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And I suppose technically option 4 is "stay on an older version of Statiq" - but that's not a good choice)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've gone for option 2 here, and my site is generating without errors again.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I hit a rather confusing issue with a release a while back, which initially appeared to be a Unicorn problem. But after investigating the details, I think this was actually an infrastructure problem causing some odd behaviour. I doubt this is a common problem, but still worth writing down in case it's a challenge for anyone else... &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release in question was a containerised build. It had been running fine for some time, and I'd already released this build to the "dev" and "qa" instances of the site. The release process was set up to deploy the new images to Kubernetes, and then once the CM image was deployed and started, trigger the Unicorn sync to complete the deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the release was triggered on the pre-prod instance of the site. The images deployed ok, but then the Unicorn sync failed. I've had instances in the past where synchronisation had failed for data-related reasons - a missing file in source control, or something an editor had done to the content tree. But in this instance it failed with a much stranger error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;Creating master:/sitecore/System/Modules/some-item failed. API returned null.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google wasn't a great deal of help here. Searching for references to that message gave one hit - and that was in &lt;a href="https://github.com/SitecoreUnicorn/Rainbow/blob/3366c917df58fe0f7e6ca6d1a3b0cb267dd4c7f4/src/Rainbow.Storage.Sc/Deserialization/DefaultDeserializer.cs#L384" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the GitHub repository that the code in question came from&lt;/a&gt;. So no easy answers for this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried repeating the deployment - which gave the same error. And I tried pulling down the source and running a sync on my local instance - which gave no errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, for a while I was a bit stumped...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A possible explanation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to first-principles I thought about two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, what is the code doing when the exception is thrown? Well looking at the source, it's trying to create an item from a template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-highlight="3" data-enlighter-language="csharp" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;AssertTemplate(database, new ID(serializedItemData.TemplateId), serializedItemData.Path);

Item targetItem = ItemManager.AddFromTemplate(serializedItemData.Name, new ID(serializedItemData.TemplateId), destinationParentItem, new ID(serializedItemData.Id));

if (targetItem == null)
    throw new DeserializationException("Creating " + serializedItemData.DatabaseName + ":" + serializedItemData.Path + " failed. API returned null.");

targetItem.Versions.RemoveAll(true);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call to &lt;code&gt;AddFromTemplate()&lt;/code&gt; is returning null - which leads to the exception being thrown.
Why might that call fail by returning null? It's not obvious, but likely it's to do with some unexpected data somewhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second difference is that the infrastructure is different between pre-prod and dev/qa. The client's infrastructure choices for this instance mean that there are two CM servers in the pre-prod deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking about that made me wonder if the cause here might be related to those multiple CM instances. What if the deployment was starting with a connection to one CM instance, and then getting swapped to the other one as the containers updated? And that lead me to thinking about clearing caches - because that could be a reason the in-memory data might be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in fact clearing the cache on the active CM instance did get rid of the error, and allow the sync to complete correctly. And none of the other things I'd tried had done so. So I'm fairly sure something data and cache related is what was happening when I saw the error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing this problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, turns out this is probably an interesting variation on something I've discussed before. The problem comes down to how &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2021/revisiting-waiting-for-kubernetes-deployments" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it waits for container updates&lt;/a&gt;. If you have multiple CM roles and a release process which performs post-release tasks on your Sitecore CM role, you must wait for all of these roles to update before continuing. (And in fact, this issue came up before I posted that previous problem - it's not recurred since I made the changes I wrote about there)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once again I'm thinking life is simpler with only one CM instance running at a time...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Pesky Paper for PDF Printers</title>

		<updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Recently I needed to do an odd bit of printing. I needed to generate an A3 PDF for printing which had crop marks around it. That means it needs to be printed to "a bit larger than A3" size. In the past I'd used Foxit's PDF printer for this (where it just worked), but that no longer seems to be free. Turns out the default Windows PDF printer needs a bit of hackery to enable using odd-sized paper. I'm sure I'll find myself needing to do this again in the future, so this is a reminder for my future self.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've got a Photoshop drawing that's a "just over A3" sized. It's an A3 print with what printers call "bleed" - the extra bit of your design you have to leave around the edges of a print to ensure that once it's cropped to its right size, the printing goes all the way to the edges of the page. The print company I'm using needs a PDF with crop marks on the image so they can print that extra and trim then trim the artwork to the right size. But when I try to send image this to Microsoft's Windows 10 PDF printer, I can't select a custom paper size, and the choices don't include anything larger than A3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-MissingPaperOptions.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Print properties, with fixed set of sizes" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-MissingPaperOptions.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in theory, you should be able to add new paper sizes to printers. There's a UI option in the "Printers &amp;amp; Scanners" page in settings, for "Print server properties":&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-PrintServerProperties.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The 'Printers &amp;amp; scanners' dialog" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-PrintServerProperties.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in there, you should be able to create new "custom" paper sizes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-NewFormDialog.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding a new paper size" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-NewFormDialog.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And those should then be able to show up in the paper choices. You can see the new option in some print drivers installed on my computer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-NewPaperVisible.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="New paper size in a LaserJet driver" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-NewPaperVisible.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it doesn't work with Microsoft's PDF Printer - the larger paper sizes I tried to add would never shows up there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a load of "standard Windows trouble-shooting" (you know: rebooting and reinstalling stuff) I did a pile of googling. That eventually &lt;a href="https://franklinheath.co.uk/2015/08/29/custom-page-sizes-for-microsoft-print-to-pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lead me to this blog post&lt;/a&gt; about adding custom paper sizes to the MS PDF printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions there provided the outline of what I needed to do. Broadly that's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look in the registry to find some data about the PDF Printer driver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use that data to find some special files on disk which describe the printer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit one of those files to add some extra data that enables custom paper sizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds way more complex than it should be - but achievable. However, there were a couple of tricky points for me here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up was understanding how the registry data maps to the disk data. The key thing here is that there's actually two things to look at in the registry. First is under &lt;code&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\ CurrentVersion\Print\Printers\Microsoft Print to PDF&lt;/code&gt;. There's an entry here that tells you which folder to look in for the print driver data under &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32\spool\V4Dirs&lt;/code&gt;. All the folders are named with GUIDs, so you need to know which one to open:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-FindingThePrintDriverFolder.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Finding the right folder for the print driver files" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-FindingThePrintDriverFolder.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then you need to look at a second bit of data under &lt;code&gt;...\Microsoft Print to PDF\PrinterDriverData&lt;/code&gt; in the registry, in order to find the name of the individual data file to edit. It's also given a fairly random looking name, so would be hard to guess. But the registry item, combined with the blog post saying it's a &lt;code&gt;gpd&lt;/code&gt; file gives you the info:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-FindingThePrintDriverFile.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Finding the right file in the print driver folder" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-FindingThePrintDriverFile.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having worked that out, I was able to follow the instructions in the blog about editing the file I'd found. But it didn't work for me, and it took some time for me to work out why...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out the issue is actually pretty simple. The article describes addings some extra markup to the printer definition, which allows the print driver to see the custom paper sizes defined in the "Print server properties" dialog from earlier. It suggests you add following text into the file immediately after the &lt;code&gt;*DefaultOption:&lt;/code&gt; entry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-highlight="5" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;*Option: CUSTOMSIZE
{
*rcNameID: =USER_DEFINED_SIZE_DISPLAY
*MinSize: PAIR(936000, 1332000)
*MaxSize: PAIR(5346000, 7560000)
*MaxPrintableWidth: 5346000
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as highlighted, the mark-up defined here gives some bounds for the "size" of your printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I missed initially is that you have to make sure that you set these to be &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; than your desired paper size. Otherwise the print driver will (sensibly) filter out the choices you've defined which "don't fit" on its maximum paper size. That doesn't really make sense for a "print to PDF" driver because it should have no physical limits. But it does make sense for the base abstraction all print drivers are built around, as that assumes that physical paper size is a key property of printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I should probably have &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-hardware/drivers/print/supporting-user-defined-paper-sizes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;taken the time to work out what the units above actually mean&lt;/a&gt;, but to be honest it all looked a bit complex, so I just hacked it. I increased the most significant digit of each of the width &amp;amp; height fields by one to make the maximum larger. And the after a bit more confusion where this sort-of worked but not quite, I realised that you also need to increase the MaxPrintableWidth property too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-highlight="5,6" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;*Option: CUSTOMSIZE
{
*rcNameID: =USER_DEFINED_SIZE_DISPLAY
*MinSize: PAIR(936000, 1332000)
*MaxSize: PAIR(6346000, 8560000)
*MaxPrintableWidth: 8560000
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't change that value to match the largest dimension of your paper, you end up with "unprintable" areas because the printer thinks it can't actually draw on that bit of the paper. That shows up as "hatched" areas in the print preview dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as those changes are saved, the new size appears in my printer options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-PaperSizeNowVisible.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="New paper size showing up in the PDF printer" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-PaperSizeNowVisible.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I can generate my PDFs successfully, on "a bit bigger than A3" paper, to allow for cropping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all that I have to echo the writer of the blog post linked above - why don't Microsoft ship this extra config by default? Seems like "print to any sized PDF" would be a sensbible feature. And it would save us all the hacking above...&lt;/p&gt;

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I wasn't at SUGCON this year, but I was watching the Twitter reactions, and I've chatted to a few community people about what was said at the event. And in amongst all the exiting technical stuff about XM Cloud, I think there's one slide which really stands out to me... &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Gatagordo/status/1507405611675308036"&gt;&lt;img alt="SUGCON presentation slide showing Symphony connecting to other CMS content sources" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/04-SUGCON-Composibility-Slide.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Gatagordo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gert Gullentops&lt;/a&gt;' twitter for the image]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's showing the idea that the future "front-end as-a-service" product Sitecore are working on (Sometimes referred to as Symphony - the new SaaS-deployed enhancement to the current Horizon editing UI) will allow you to source content from multiple content management systems. And that's a really big break from the traditional CMS or DXP Sitecore have sold. We're used to products which can provide the editing and rendering tools for the content they store internally. Integrations with other content sources are usually custom code. In the past it's usually boiled down to "copy the data in" approaches (Using Data Exchange Framework, or your own code) for most people, and the occasional custom database provider implementation (like the way you can see Commerce products in the content tree with Experience Commerce) if you're feeling particularly clever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's really interesting to see content integration becoming a first-class part of the Sitecore ecosystem for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's code you don't have to write any more&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Wherever the system can provide a good implementation for code that used to be our problem, it's helpful. We can now focus that development effort on something new - a customer feature we didn't have time for before...
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It fits with the "composable" model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As we move away from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;monolithic&lt;/a&gt; DXP, the ease of plugging together systems becomes more important. Supporting common APIs and standards to allow interoperability means we have more flexibility to choose the right tools for our projects. What one of my colleages has been calling the &lt;i&gt;"best of need"&lt;/i&gt; architecture. You don't have to pick all the bundled tools of one vendor, but you get to select the tools which fit your requirements best from the whole market. And they should plug together easily.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;It's good for omnichannel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A specific example of how composability helps is the idea that many businesses want to curate content for use across all their channels. Writing product copy once, and then using it on the web, in adverts and in catalogs for example. Being able to easily integrate your web CMS with the business' central content source makes that content reuse simpler and more effective.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a really clear signal of Sitecore's change of focus and direction recently - So I'm fascinated to see how this pans out in client projects...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Challenges with Sitecore's GraphQL tooling</title>

		<updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I've started looking at the details of the Headless Services GraphQL endpoints in Sitecore recently. And as part of this research, I got a bit confused trying to test queries in the Sitecore UI. I've worked out what was up, but maybe others will find themselves in a similar situation, so: &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look at at &lt;code&gt;Json Rendering&lt;/code&gt; in the content tree, one of the fields it has is for a custom GraphQL query to help you format its data. Helpfully, that includes a built-in query prototyping tool under the "Open xGraph Browser" link:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-JsonRenderingFields.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The GraphQL field in a Json Rendering" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-JsonRenderingFields.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use this to tweak your queries and verify that they return the data you think they do. But if you're new to using GraphQL with Sitecore, there are a some small gotchas you might hit here. When you click the link shown in the field above, you get taken to the prototyping page. The code tries to pass across your query along with some context data, but currently it doesn't work very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="big-queries-dont-get-passed"&gt;Big queries don't get passed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a certain size, the query in your Content Editor field won't be passed. If that happens you'll get a message in the editor to warn you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;# Query was too long to transfer into editor.
# Please copy and paste your integrated mode query here to execute it.
{
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it says, if this happens you'll need to manually copy your query in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="other-context-data-doesnt-seem-to-get-passed-either"&gt;Other context data doesn't seem to get passed either&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you click to open the prototyping page, the querystring appears to include a lot of useful data. If you decode the url, you'll get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;https://cm.jsstest.localhost/sitecore/api/graph/edge/ui?query=# Editing here does not save the query on the item; copy it back when done!

query Test($contextItem: String!, $language: String!)
{
  item(path: $contextItem, language:$language) {
      id
      name
    }
}&amp;amp;variables={
  "datasource": "",
  "contextItem": "/sitecore/content/JssTest"
}
&amp;amp;sc_apikey={BDC711CC-8F6E-4B61-AF4B-27E39360CD85}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the version I'm looking at, (Sitecore v10.2, JSS v19) only the query comes across into the prototyping UI. And that means you'll see some errors while you try to get your query to run. First up, hitting "play" in the middle of the window will get you a security error if your endpoint is secured:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-GraphQL-Security-Error.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="GraphQL playground complaining about lack of API key" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-GraphQL-Security-Error.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It says &lt;code&gt;Server cannot be reached&lt;/code&gt; in the query endpoint address field, and the response JSON includes the message &lt;code&gt;SSC API Key is required. Pass ith 'sc_apikey' query string or HTTP header.&lt;/code&gt; in its data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the API key it needs is probably in page querystring, but for me it wasn't passed through to the GraphQL endpoint correctly. I needed to manually move it from the page's URL into the url used for the query endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Move-GraphQL-API-Key.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Moving the API key from the browser url to the endpoint url" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Move-GraphQL-API-Key.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having done that I hit a second error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "GraphQL.ExecutionError: Variable '$contextItem' is invalid. Received a null input for a non-null field. ---&amp;gt; GraphQL.Execution.InvalidValueException: Variable '$contextItem' is invalid. Received a null input for a non-null field.\r\n   at GraphQL.Execution.ExecutionHelper.AssertValidValue(ISchema schema, IGraphType type, Object input, String fieldName)\r\n   at GraphQL.Execution.ExecutionHelper.GetVariableValue(Document document, ISchema schema, VariableDefinition variable, Object input)\r\n   at GraphQL.Execution.ExecutionHelper.GetVariableValues(Document document, ISchema schema, VariableDefinitions variableDefinitions, Inputs inputs)\r\n   at GraphQL.DocumentExecuter.BuildExecutionContext(ISchema schema, Object root, Document document, Operation operation, Inputs inputs, Object userContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken, Metrics metrics, IEnumerable`1 listeners, Boolean throwOnUnhandledException)\r\n   at GraphQL.DocumentExecuter.&amp;lt;ExecuteAsync&amp;gt;d__8.MoveNext()\r\n   --- End of inner exception stack trace ---",
      "extensions": {
        "code": "INVALID_VALUE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's a complicated way of saying "you added a required variable called &lt;code&gt;$contextItem&lt;/code&gt; in your query, but you've not passed a value for it". But if you look back at the data we decoded from the URL before, that variable is there. So why can't the query see it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me a while to work this out, because I couldn't understand where the UI was looking for the variable. But it was right under my nose the whole time, as it turns out that the parameters for your query should be under the "query variables" pane that's hiding at the bottom left of the page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Finding-GraphQL-Params.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Location of the GraphQL parameters tab" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Finding-GraphQL-Params.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's minimised by default, so you need to click it or drag it up to see the contents. And I found that it was empty in this case - which would explain the error. So I tried copying in the data I'd decoded from the URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Adding-GraphQL-Params.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Adding data to the GraphQL parameters" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Adding-GraphQL-Params.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's a step forward - the error has changed to say that it's the "language" variable which is missing now. Which is right - that wasn't in the URL data at all. But if I add it, everything works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Succesful-GraphQL-Query.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="A successful GraphQL query" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/03-Succesful-GraphQL-Query.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Having spoken to Sitecore Support, the failure to pass the API key and the standard parameters is confirmed as a bug. Speaking to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jflh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jeff L'Heureux&lt;/a&gt; at Sitecore, he pointed out that the tooling used for this GraphQL playground has been changed in a recent release - so the lack of wiring up of these parameters was probably caused by that change. If this is an issue for you, reference bug 523547 when you speak to support to raise its priority. But hopefully this will be fixed in a future release.

		<title>Diagnosing a packaging failure</title>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I came across an interesting issue generating a Sitecore Package recently. Googling the issue didn't give me the whole answer, so it's time to enhance the internet again with a explanation of what I saw and why I think it happened...&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-issue"&gt;The issue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was building a package as a backup before making some changes to a client's site. I added a series of "sources" to the package for some sets of items, but one final bit of the site did not work. The dialog accepted my choice of items and their children, but when I tried to close the dialog for adding a new source:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-CloseTheDialog.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The close button on the add-new-source dialog for a Sitecore package" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-CloseTheDialog.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got an error back instead of success:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-InitialErrorDialog.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-InitialErrorDialog.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the "details" button there got me a YSOD:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-DetailedErrorDialog.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-DetailedErrorDialog.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Google's benefit, the interesting part of the stack trace for this was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;[ArgumentOutOfRangeException: startIndex cannot be larger than length of string.
Parameter name: startIndex]
   System.String.InternalSubStringWithChecks(Int32 startIndex, Int32 length, Boolean fAlwaysCopy)
   System.String.Substring(Int32 startIndex) +19
   Sitecore.Install.Items.ItemFieldsProperties.GetFieldsProperties(Item item) +432
   Sitecore.Install.Items.ItemToEntryConverter.InternalConvert(Item item, IProcessingContext context)
   Sitecore.Install.Framework.BaseConverter`1.Convert(T entry, IProcessingContext context) +69
   Sitecore.Install.Framework.InternalSink.Put(T entry) +97
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a good developer I tried searching for that issue, and came up with only &lt;a href="https://www.sitecore-cms.de/2013/09/startindex-cannot-be-larger-than-length.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one interesting hit, in a pretty old blog post&lt;/a&gt;. That dates back to 2013 (!) and describes the same error I saw, but said that Sitecore Support said "this is your problem" when asked about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So useful to see that someone else saw the problem - but didn't help me specifically...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-underlying-crash"&gt;The underlying crash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the stack trace didn't say much of help, the next step was to find out what the code was doing when the exception occurred. Breaking out &lt;a href="https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ILSpy&lt;/a&gt;, the method being called there is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-CodeForError.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Decompiled code for the stack trace above" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-CodeForError.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That code is going through all the fields on an item to make a pipe-separate list, and then finally it tries to remove the first pipe in order to return the list as a string. Maybe not the best way of achieving that behaviour, but we'll work with what we've got...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious failure path here is "what happens if the item has no fields"? No data would be added to the &lt;code&gt;StringBuilder&lt;/code&gt; and hence an exception occurs when you try to skip the first character of the resultant empty string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="finding-the-cause"&gt;Finding the cause&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next question then, is why do we have an item with no fields? Surely all items have some fields? They all inherit from the standard Sitecore base item, right? Well I did some snooping through the content tree to try and work out what was broken. Since the issue appeared making packages, I tried adding different subtrees of the content until I found the specific place in the tree which caused the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-ItemWithNoFields.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The item with no fields" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-ItemWithNoFields.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does indeed have no visible fields, but it doesn't show any obvious error. So the next logical thing to check is the template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-AMissingTemplate.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-AMissingTemplate.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there we have the issue - the template this item uses inherits from something that's missing! And that's where all the fields went, which in turn caused the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect something like this was the underlying cause of the bug in the blog post I found before, but it can be hard to find the dodgy item in a big content tree. Particularly because the issue only really revealed itself in the specific situation of packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd recommend using a sort of "binary search" approach here. If packaging a specific item breaks, go down to its children and try to make packages of just each child. Work out which one (or ones) fail and which succeed. Doing that until you're confident which items fail, and which items succeed will help you to work out what item (or template used by items) is broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those data templates - they're important...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Fancy paste behaviour in WPF</title>
		<author>
			<name>Jeremy Davis</name>
		</author>
		<link href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/fancy-paste-behaviour-wpf" />
		<updated>0001-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I realised recently that I've become quite used to way many web forms let you paste image data straight into a text field. The behaviour of "upload the image data, and insert the correct mark-up for the image" is a really helpful shortcut when you're editing DevOps tickets, or Stack Overflow answers. So I started wondering how easy it would be to add that to the text editing tool I use for writing these blog posts. Turns out, not too hard, because WPF has some helpful extension patterns...&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-challenge"&gt;The challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm typing this in a (very) simple WPF app I wrote. It's a basic text editor, which I've enhanced with a few helpful extras which make my writing process easier for me. I have shortcuts to insert common Markdown and HTML tags, just to save typing. It's got a "pick the right tags" dialog, which can look at my current blog posts and give me a pick list of tags I've used before. And it's able to fire up the Statiq generator to give me close-to-realtime previews of what I'm writing. The editor's code is pretty horrible right now - but it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Markdown is plain text, the bulk of the UI is a WPF &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; that I can type into. But if you put any sort of data that isn't text onto your clipboard and try to paste it into this textbox control it won't work. The context menu option for paste will disabled and shortcut keys will do nothing. For example, if I copy an image in Paint.Net I see a greyed-out context menu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-PasteDenied.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The context menu of a WPF textbox, with the paste option greyed out" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-PasteDenied.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which isn't surprising - why would a default textbox know what to do with anything that wasn't text? So the challenge is to work out how to extend this behaviour...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="composition-for-the-win"&gt;Composition for the win&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways WPF improves upon old-style Windows Forms is that it favours a "composition before inheritance" model for adding customisations. It has a collection of extension points where you can provide composable helper objects which give new behaviour to a control. For example, in WPF we have "adorner" classes to change the way a component draws itself, rather than the old "override the &lt;code&gt;Paint()&lt;/code&gt; method that was required in Forms. Because they're composable, they are potentially reusable across multiple controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It happens that WPF has one of these extension points for logical behaviours too - so that's the place to start implementing this behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a-simple-example"&gt;A simple example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with this, you need to add a Nuget package to your project: &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviours.Wpf&lt;/code&gt;. That gives you the relevant types to implement your own reusable behaviours. You start with a class for your new behaviour:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;public class PasteBehaviour : Behaviour&amp;lt;TextBox&amp;gt;
{
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By making the type parameter to &lt;code&gt;Behaviour&lt;/code&gt; a &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; here, we're saying that this behaviour expects to work on textboxes. But you could use more generic WPF UI types here, if your behaviour doesn't require such a specific type. And with that defined, you can attach it to any relevant UI component with some XAML. For example, on my textbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="xml" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;&amp;lt;TextBox&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;behaviour:Interaction.Behaviors&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;local:PasteBehavior/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/behaviour:Interaction.Behaviors&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/TextBox&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the &lt;code&gt;behaviour&lt;/code&gt; namespace maps to that Nuget package's namespace: &lt;code&gt;http://schemas.microsoft.com/xaml/behaviors&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;local&lt;/code&gt; is the namespace for where the custom behaviour class is declared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make this type do custom pasting behaviour, it needs two key things. First is logic to attach and detach the its code from the UI element. And the second is the logic for whatever the new behaviour should actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attaching and detaching are pretty simple - there methods to overload in your behaviour. In those, you can attach and detach whatever event handlers you need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;protected override void OnAttached()
{
    base.OnAttached();

    CommandManager.AddPreviewExecutedHandler(AssociatedObject, onPreviewExecuted);
    CommandManager.AddPreviewCanExecuteHandler(AssociatedObject, onPreviewCanExecute);
}

protected override void OnDetaching()
{
    base.OnDetaching();

    CommandManager.RemovePreviewExecutedHandler(AssociatedObject, onPreviewExecuted);
    CommandManager.RemovePreviewCanExecuteHandler(AssociatedObject, onPreviewCanExecute);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the key events to handle are ones that preview the "can execute" and "executed" events for some routed commands. A routed command is the way WPF binds actions like "button clicked" or "shortcut key pressed" to UI elements. So by previewing these we can spot pasting behaviour however it's triggered, and apply our custom logic. The &lt;code&gt;AssociatedObject&lt;/code&gt; here is whatever &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; this &lt;code&gt;Behaviour&amp;lt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; class has been bound to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The logic for previewing the "can execute" event is fairly simple. If the command being previewed is "Paste" we need to override the logic for "can this control accept the clipboard data format that's present" and allow it to accept image data. (The default control we're extending will already handle text here) We can do that with something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;private void onPreviewCanExecute(object sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Command == ApplicationCommands.Paste)
    {
        e.CanExecute = Clipboard.ContainsImage();
        e.Handled = Clipboard.ContainsImage();
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By setting the value of &lt;code&gt;CanExecute&lt;/code&gt; we're extending this "can the control accept the data" logic. And by setting &lt;code&gt;Handled&lt;/code&gt; we tell the runtime that we made a change. And with that in place, we should see that the context menu "paste" entry our textbox will not be greyed out if we have bitmap data on the clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next the code needs to extend the actual "data is being pasted" event - which the attachment logic above is sending to a &lt;code&gt;onPreviewExecuted&lt;/code&gt; method in this behaviour object. As before, that needs to check that the command being processed is "paste" and that the clipboard data is an image. But if those tests pass, it can get on and perform its custom functions, before again setting &lt;code&gt;Handled&lt;/code&gt; true to show it did stuff with the event. And as noted above, the &lt;code&gt;AssociatedObject&lt;/code&gt; here (whatever we've bound this behaviour logic too) is a &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; so we can do operations on the text it contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;private void onPreviewExecuted(object sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Command == ApplicationCommands.Paste)
    {
        if (Clipboard.ContainsImage())
        {
            // work out a disk filename and web url for our new image
            // save the image to disk

            var markup = $"![Alt text here](/web-path-to-file/goes-here.png)";

            AssociatedObject.Text = AssociatedObject.Text.Insert(AssociatedObject.SelectionStart, markup);

            e.Handled = true;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the outcome of all of this is that the custom code written above "previews" the events sent to the textbox. We get to run the extra code before the default behaviour of the textbox runs, and hence we can extend its features. So now when I copy some image data from Paint.Net, I see this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-PasteAllowed.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The context menu of a WPF textbox, with the paste option enabled" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-PasteAllowed.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I click "Paste" or hit &lt;code&gt;Ctrl-V&lt;/code&gt; I now get my link inserted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-PasteCompleted.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-PasteCompleted.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've skipped how the clipboard data ends up as an image file with a URL here. But that's not really relevant to the basic pattern for extending paste behaviour. (And saving images is fairly easily googleable) And what's above is pretty much all the code required to allow doing this a data conversion to paste something that's not text into a texbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to fiddle with this yourself, there's a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/files/PasteBehavior.zip"&gt;zip of the basic code above you can grab if you want&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
</content>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;I realised recently that I've become quite used to way many web forms let you paste image data straight into a text field. The behaviour of &amp;quot;upload the image data, and insert the correct mark-up for the image&amp;quot; is a really helpful shortcut when you're editing DevOps tickets, or Stack Overflow answers. So I started wondering how easy it would be to add that to the text editing tool I use for writing these blog posts. Turns out, not too hard, because WPF has some helpful extension patterns...&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this soon after I post it then it's very nearly the end of the "grace period" where anyone can run Docker Desktop. As of 1st February &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq#:~:text=Do%20I%20need%20to%20pay%20to%20continue%20to%20use%20Docker%20Desktop%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;if your business meets certain requirements you have to pay for each user&lt;/a&gt;. So what can us Sitecore devs do if we aren't in a position to pay that fee? Well the good news is you can run Docker without the Desktop bit, and it's not too tricky once you wrap your head around a few things...&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should note that I've been working this out on Windows 10 Professional. It's possible that this needs tweaking for Windows 11, but I've only had the chance to test the steps against Win 10 VMs in Azure as that's my use case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="first-prerequisites"&gt;First: Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft provide two optional features for Windows which are needed for Docker to run. One is the Hyper-V virtualisation infrastructure that allows the Docker engine to run VMs, and the other is Microsoft's containers feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to verify and install optional features via PowerShell. You can call &lt;code&gt;Get-WindowsOptionalFeature&lt;/code&gt; to test if a feature has been installed, and &lt;code&gt;Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature&lt;/code&gt; if you need to add it. So I tried wrapping those up in a helper function to install a named feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function VerifyWindowsFeature
{
	param(
		[string]$featureName
	)
	
	$hasFeature = (Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName $featureName -Online | Select -ExpandProperty State) -eq "Enabled"
	if(-not $hasFeature)
	{
		Write-Host "$featureName feature not currently installed - adding" -ForegroundColor Yellow
		$result = Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName $featureName -NoRestart -All

		return $result.RestartNeeded
	}
	else
	{
		Write-Host "$featureName feature is already installed" -ForegroundColor Green
		return $false
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing features like this often requires a restart - but helpfully you can tell Windows "don't reboot please" and get a flag back saying whether a reboot is required. So this function can be called a couple of times to install the two features needed, and then we can test if a reboot is required:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function EnsureWindowsFeatures
{
	$containersNeedsRestart = VerifyWindowsFeature "Containers"
	$hyperVNeedsReboot = VerifyWindowsFeature "Microsoft-Hyper-V"

	if($containersNeedsRestart -or $hyperVNeedsReboot)
	{
		throw "Restart required after adding Windows features"
	}
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I toyed with the idea of using &lt;code&gt;Restart-Computer&lt;/code&gt; here to force a reboot, but ended up leaving it out. I'm not sure that's the best idea. But after this has run and a reboot has been performed (if needed) the machine should be in a state to install Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="second-the-docker-engine"&gt;Second: The Docker Engine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not well advertised, but Docker does provide a simple download for just the Windows container engine. I found this via &lt;a href="https://lippertmarkus.com/2021/09/04/containers-without-docker-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a helpful blog post&lt;/a&gt;, which has a very basic script for installing the Docker engine. It's interesting to note that this download is specifically for Windows containers though - unlike the Docker Desktop install, it doesn't appear to support switching over to run Linux images. The post does highlight what you need to do in order to run in mixed-mode though, if you want to investigate that - but I was focused on Windows containers for this, so I've stuck with the simplest solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That blog post gave the basic outline for getting the Docker engine to run: Download and extract the zip file, add its location to the system path, and register the Docker service. But the script in the blog post doesn't deal with the idea that you might want to change versions, or address the issue of running containers when you're not an admin. So a bit of rework was in order for my needs, and I got to experimenting...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I wanted to check was whether the Docker service was already running. That's fairly easy to do with PowerShell - you can filter the results of &lt;code&gt;Get-Service&lt;/code&gt; by the known name of the Docker service that gets installed. If there are results then the service exists. The result is an object which gives you the name and state of that service, so you can tell if it's running or not. And if it is you can check if there are any active containers. I probably need a better way to handle this, but for a first pass the script throws an exception at that point - I didn't want to try and delete the service if it was working. But otherwise the service can be stopped and (since we know at this point that the Docker code must already be present) the command line to unregister it can be called:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function StopAndRemoveExistingService
{
    param(
        [string]$svcName
    )
    $service = Get-Service | where { $_.Name -eq $svcName }
    if($service.length -eq 0)
    {
        Write-Host "No existing service for $svcName" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
    else
    {
        $service | % {
          Write-Host "Service '$($_.DisplayName)' exists" -ForegroundColor Yellow
          if($_.Status -eq "Running")
          {
            Write-Host "$($_.Name) service is running" -ForegroundColor Yellow

            $items = docker ps -q

            if($items -ne $null)
            {
                throw "Containers are running - stop them before running this script"
            }
          }

          Write-Host "Removing service" -ForegroundColor Green
          Stop-Service $_.Name
          dockerd --unregister-service
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with the service stopped and unregistered (if it existed) the next job is to download the archive that Docker provide. Given I was running this code fairly often while I tested, I optimised it a bit by avoiding the download if the file already existed. The &lt;code&gt;$name&lt;/code&gt; variable here is just to make the debug output more readable, as I figured this function might be useful for more than one download in this bit of work: (Spoiler - it was...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function DownloadFile
{
    param(
        [string]$name,
        [string]$downloadUrl,
        [string]$output
    )

    if(-not(Test-Path $output))
    {
        Write-Host "Downloading $name file" -ForegroundColor Green
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $downloadUrl -OutFile $output
    }
    else
    {
        Write-Host "$name already exists" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working out the newest &lt;code&gt;$downloadUrl&lt;/code&gt; here (for the latest version of Docker) is a project for another day - but for the moment it's easy enough to call this function with a fixed version string like &lt;code&gt;https://download.docker.com/win/static/stable/x86_64/docker-20.10.8.zip&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that zip downloaded, it can be extracted easily enough:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;Expand-Archive $dockerZip -DestinationPath $dockerEnginePath -Force
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to be able to run the "register Docker as a service" command, the code needs to make sure that the folder which has been unzipped is in the system path. The easiest way to handle that is to check if the install folder is already in the path, and if not add it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function EnsureDockerInPath
{
    param(
        [string]$installPath
    )

    $path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine")
    if(-not($path.Contains($installPath)))
    {
        $newPath = "$($env:path);$($installPath)"
        Write-Host "New path: $newPath" -ForegroundColor Green
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $newPath, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
        $env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
    }
    else
    {
        Write-Host "Path is already correct" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suspect this isn't "right" as there are circumstances where the test might get the wrong answer, but it's good enough for a first pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that done, it's easy to install and start the service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function EnsureDockerServiceRunning
{
    param(
        [string]$svcName
    )
	
    Write-Host "Registering &amp;amp; starting $svcName service" -ForegroundColor Green
    dockerd --register-service
    Start-Service $svcName
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those functions are enough to get a basic install running. They can be combined together into a simple overall script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;#Requires -RunAsAdministrator
param(
    [string]$dockerEnginePath = "C:\",
    [string]$dockerInstallPath = "C:\Docker",
    [string]$dockerEngineUrl = "https://download.docker.com/win/static/stable/x86_64/docker-20.10.8.zip",
    [string]$dockerZip = "docker.zip",

    [string]$serviceName = "docker",
)

# Make sure Hyper-V etc is installed
EnsureWindowsFeatures

# Go to this user's downloads folder
pushd $(New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application).NameSpace('shell:Downloads').Self.Path

# stop &amp;amp; remove any running service if possible
StopAndRemoveExistingService $serviceName

# Fetch the docker engine and unzip it
DownloadFile "Docker" $dockerEngineUrl $dockerZip
Expand-Archive $dockerZip -DestinationPath $dockerEnginePath -Force
Remove-Item $dockerZip

# Make sure the docker folder is in the path
EnsureDockerInPath $dockerInstallPath

# Get docker service running
EnsureDockerServiceRunning $serviceName

popd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running that script and dealing with any reboots required you should be able to run a simple test container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;docker run hello-world
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, you won't be able to run Sitecore yet...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="third-docker-compose"&gt;Third: Docker Compose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current versions of the Docker engine include Docker Compose as a built-in command - but they have v2 built in to the command line tools. The Docker &lt;a href="https://github.com/sitecore/docker-examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Compose files provided by Sitecore for running developer instances&lt;/a&gt; require v1 at present, however. If you try to start these examples from the command line after running the install outlined above, you'd have to be running &lt;code&gt;docker compose up&lt;/code&gt;. Note the use of a space rather than a hyphen here. That's &lt;code&gt;docker compose&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; - a subtlety that tripped me up quite hard. The hyphened variant will give a "command not found" error at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But running the version with the space also gets an error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-IncorrectComposeVersion.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="A console showing an error message caused by the incorrect docker-compose version" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-IncorrectComposeVersion.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Google's benefit, the important part of that message is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;Error response from daemon: 
Unrecognised volume spec: file '\\.\pipe\docker_engine` cannot be mapped. 
Only directories can be mapped on this platform.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That looks like something tricky, but it's actually just this versioning issue. When you're running Docker Desktop there's a config setting for "stick with Compose V1", and that distratcted me for a while trying to find the option for doing this with the simple version that has been downloaded here. But that's entirely the wrong approach, it turns out. You're stuck with V2 for the built-in version here, but you can separately download a V1 release of the "docker-compose" command and use that instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code for the separate &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; command lives on GitHub, and you can find assorted versions &lt;a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in the releases there&lt;/a&gt;. So to get something that's compatible with the files we're working with, we need to take the most recent V1 release. There's no installation required here. The download is a plain &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; file which can be copied to the Docker folder we created above, and run as-is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra code to cope with that is fairly simple, and can be added into the base script above. It needs a couple of extra parameters to the overall script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;param(
    [string]$composeEngineUrl = "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-Windows-x86_64.exe",
    [string]$composeExe = "docker-compose.exe"
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the download operation can be added to the script's logic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-highlight="&amp;quot;4-6&amp;quot;" data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;# Get docker service running
EnsureDockerServiceRunning $serviceName

DownloadFile "Compose" $composeEngineUrl $composeExe
Unblock-File $composeExe
Move-Item $composeExe $dockerInstallPath

popd
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding that onto the basic script allows you to run an install which will be able to start an instance of Sitecore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-SuccessfulVersion.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Installs script allowing 'docker version' to run" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-SuccessfulVersion.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note, if the path to Docker is added by this script, you may well need to open a new PowerShell window in order to run Docker. I thought I'd done the business necessary to refresh the session path, but it doesn't always work for me. Another issue to look into later. But starting a new PowerShell session does always seem to get the new path so the workaround is simple enough for the moment)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fourth-non-admin-users"&gt;Fourth: Non-admin users&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that took me a while to work out was that the default installation only seems to work if you're running docker commands from an elevated console window. Users who don't have "adminsitrator" rights will get an error message that the Docker CLI commands can't access the named pipe used to talk to the engine even though the service is up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could be an issue for some users, so I did a bit more digging into how this might be resolved. I came across some google results explaining that you need to &lt;a href="https://github.com/tfenster/dockeraccesshelper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;explicity grant rights to non-admin&lt;/a&gt; users to allow them access to the Docker service. I didn't want to have an external dependency for this bit of script, so I pulled in the core behaviour there to a function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;function GrantRights
{
    param(
        $domain,
        $user
    )

    $account="$($domain)\$($user)"
    $npipe = "\\.\pipe\docker_engine"                                                                                 
    $dInfo = New-Object "System.IO.DirectoryInfo" -ArgumentList $npipe                                               
    $dSec = $dInfo.GetAccessControl()                                                                                 
    $fullControl =[System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemRights]::FullControl                                       
    $allow =[System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType]::Allow                                                  
    $rule = New-Object "System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule" -ArgumentList $account,$fullControl,$allow
    $dSec.AddAccessRule($rule)                                                                                        
    $dInfo.SetAccessControl($dSec)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of a simple install script you can call this passing &lt;code&gt;$env:userdomain&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;$env:username&lt;/code&gt; for the user credentials. But in a more complex scenario you might want to use a group, or call it for multiple users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's worth nothing that this function seems to fail if you try to run it before a fresh install of Docker has actually run a container. So I chose to put it into a separate script for reuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="winning"&gt;Winning!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with that in place, you can run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; for a Sitecore install, and it will successfully start:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-SuccessfulCompose.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="A successful run of docker-compose starting Sitecore" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-SuccessfulCompose.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you get an error starting the Docker service and Event Viewer mentions &lt;code&gt;panic.log&lt;/code&gt;, try deleting the file from &lt;code&gt;C:\ProgramData\docker&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I learned an important thing while testing this:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; If you run up a VM in Azure to test Docker (or other virtualisation stuff) then you have to be careful which VM "size" you choose. If you pick a v1 or v2 VM you'll be able to run the script here without errors, but you'll get an error that looks like this when you try to start any container:
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;Error response from daemon: 
hcsshim::CreateComputeSystem 8459c6c816e764642634ce29cfee666d30834df0f2792fba9e411d11bd0c33f6: 
The virtual machine could not be started because a required feature is not installed
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some googling, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/50099965" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;it turns out this is because only v3 and above Azure VMs have Nested Virtualisation enabled&lt;/a&gt;. And that's required to let Docker and Hyper-V run correctly inside an Azure VM. So make sure you're careful what you pick when creating your VMs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-VM-size-choice.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Azure portal dropdown for picking VM size" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-VM-size-choice.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a pile more work to do here, I think, before this is a fully-fledged install script, but it's a start. There's &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/jermdavis/6fb0a6e47d6f1342c089af4c04d29c35" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a gist of this if you fancy playing with the code yourself&lt;/a&gt; - but it's very much an experiment right now. But maybe it'll be of help to you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(And if this isn't the right approach for you, &lt;a href="https://matt-rickard.com/docker-desktop-alternatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;there are alternatives&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;If you're reading this soon after I post it then it's very nearly the end of the &amp;quot;grace period&amp;quot; where anyone can run Docker Desktop. As of 1st February &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq#:~:text=Do%20I%20need%20to%20pay%20to%20continue%20to%20use%20Docker%20Desktop%3F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;if your business meets certain requirements you have to pay for each user&lt;/a&gt;. So what can us Sitecore devs do if we aren't in a position to pay that fee? Well the good news is you can run Docker without the Desktop bit, and it's not too tricky once you wrap your head around a few things...&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I spent some time working with a colleague who couldn't get his docker instance to start up happily this week. And it's reminded me that for all its positives, there are still some challenges with understanding the underlying issues when a developer container instance breaks. I realised I need a "go read this" post for the start of future discussions like this, so here are some problems you might see, and some diagnostic suggestions I wanted a convenient way to share: &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to start your development instance and seeing something like this can be frustrating:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-FailedDockerStart.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="A console window showing docker-compose has failed to start a traefik container" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-FailedDockerStart.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something goes wrong at start-up, it's often not at all clear why. &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; says nothing helpful. So what are some of the common issues, and how can they be mitigated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="do-you-have-a-ysod"&gt;Do you have a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_of_death#:~:text=A%20Yellow%20Screen%20of%20Death%20occurs%20when%20an%20ASP.NET%20web%20app%20encounters%20a%20problem%20and%20crashes.%5B8%5D%5Bself%2Dpublished%20source%3F%5D" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;YSOD&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the problem my colleague was having. You can do &lt;code&gt;down&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;up&lt;/code&gt; as many times as you like, but if something in your Sitecore website is throwing an unhandled exception which breaks ASP.Net, you're never going to get the site to start up in its default state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way &lt;a href="https://traefik.io/traefik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Traefik&lt;/a&gt; is configured means that it relies on a health monitor endpoint in your CM container. If that does not return HTTP 200 when it is called, Traefik will not start. That leads to a really annoying situation. You're working away, and you do something that causes a YSOD. Before you fix that issue, you get distracted and end up shutting docker down. And when you come back to work, you are unable to make Sitecore start up. That makes it way harder to fix your problem you had to start with...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you see the dreaded Traefik errors, your first response should be to work out &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; it's failed. Some good diagnostic tactics are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is the CM container up?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The first thing to check is the state of your containers. That can give you a clue about which way your investigations should go. Traefik can fail if the CM container starts, but then goes down again. Or it can fail if it's up but returning errors serious enough to break the health endpoint. So make use of your favourite monitoring tool to check if the CM is actually running:
&lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-ContainerState.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="The running containers dialog from Docker Desktop - showing the state of a set of Sitecore containers" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-ContainerState.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
If the CM is down, you should look into the Service Monitor issue below, lack of memory / disk space, or similar technical issues that would prevent it from starting or from staying started. But if the CM is up you think about code and config bugs in your deployment and networking issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check the container log&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If it's up, it's worth checking what the logs say. Both the streamed Docker logs (which cover assorted outputs of your containers, and the Sitecore logs if they've been written) Log data might point you at the Service Monitor error below, or it might point you towards the health endpoint failing. So pick a tool to look at the streamed log data initially:
&lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-CMLogsWith500.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-CMLogsWith500.png" alt="The Visual Studio containers window, showing health monitor log errors for a Sitecore CM container"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
The image above is an example of the &lt;code&gt;/healthz/ready&lt;/code&gt; endpoint returning 500 - which Traefik will see as a reason not to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skip past Traefik&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since Traefik is the reverse proxy for your containers, if it's down it can be difficult to see what (if any) messages are being returned if a web request fails. One trick for bypassing this issue is to make use of the fact that Docker containers are actually proper VMs - so you can connect directly to them and run other commands. That means we can fire up PowerShell inside our misbehaving CM container:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;docker exec -it &amp;lt;your-cm-container-name&amp;gt; powershell.exe
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you type that, you should get a new powershell session inside your container. So you can use that to directly make an HTTP request to Sitecore, and see what (if any) error comes back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-language="powershell" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost/ -UseBasicParsing
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that you need to use "localhost" and "http://" here - Traefik does SSL termination for you, so inside the container doesn't use HTTPS. And it also handles the DNS naming of your site - so inside the container the site is just localhost. The parameter &lt;code&gt;-UseBasicParsing&lt;/code&gt; there is required whenever you use &lt;code&gt;Invoke-WebRequest&lt;/code&gt; on a machine which doesn't have IE installed. Console-only instances of Windows Server like this don't have IE - so you'll get an error if you forget this parameter. If you're seeing 500s in the docker log stream above, chances are you're going to get a pile of red text here, indicating the real ASP.Net error. You'll likely need to scroll up a bit to see the start of the message:
&lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-WebRequestError.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-WebRequestError.png" alt="A powershell session showing an error message returned by Invoke-Webrequest"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
Quite often, this is going to tell you what's wrong. (Though in some circumstances you may get more info from requesting the health endpoint url that's throwing 500s in the logs in the previous bullet) The example here (A DLL binding issue that prevented ASP.Net from starting up the Sitecore App) is pretty much what my colleague was suffering from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you've found your issue and corrected it, remember that you probably don't have to go through the whole up/down rigmarole. Often you can stop/delete any containers which are causing an issue, fix your problem and run &lt;code&gt;docker-compose up&lt;/code&gt; again to start up your CM or Traefik containers. They'll happily make use of the Identity Server / Solr / SQL Server ones that were (probably) already running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note, you also have the option to &lt;a href="https://t.co/xm31mbscmT" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;disable the healthchecks that prevent you seeing the error outputs&lt;/a&gt; too. Depending on your situation, you may find that easier)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="youve-got-a-networking-issue"&gt;You've got a networking issue?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find that your CM tries to spin up, but keeps throwing "can't find my databases!" type SQL errors in the Sitecore log, then a common cause is any VPN software you might be running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-DockerSqlError.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Log errors from SQL connections" src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/01-DockerSqlError.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've had this issue - if I start my office VPN client it aggressively routes all network traffic over to my corporate network. And annoyingly that includes it grabbing the "between container" network traffic that Docker is trying to use to allow  your containers to talk to each other... A good test for whether this is your issue is to disconnect the VPN, down your containers, restart Docker Desktop and then try bringing your containers back up without the VPN connected. If it works, chances are your VPN is at fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a bit of a tricky one to solve. In my case, I had to persuade my IT Ops team to create a "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_tunneling" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;split tunnel&lt;/a&gt;" configuration where only traffic for my clients and my office went over the VPN, and other (local) traffic was ignored. That allowed me to run Docker and have code in the containers access my client's networks. Great for me getting dev work done - but potentially less secure than the default VPN setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also found that it's better to start the VPN before Docker Desktop, as docker is not always happy with networking changes happening after it's started up...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="service-monitor-on-older-containers"&gt;Service Monitor on older containers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm working on a v10.0 project right now, and probably the most common failure is that the CM container's Service Monitor process fails to start. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://sitecore.stackexchange.com/a/28676"&gt;Sitecore have addressed this one in newer releases&lt;/a&gt; if you're lucky enough to be able to upgrade your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if not, I've found it seems to be made worse by your custom project code and config. This error is transient, so often stopping and starting your containers can resolve it. I've also found the error seems less likely to happen if I remove my project files from the &lt;code&gt;docker\deploy\website&lt;/code&gt; folder, start up my containers, and then publish my code after vanilla Sitecore is running. Not sure if that's specific to my project or not though - but may be of help to others?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Thanks Windows Installer - you could have just asked...</title>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've been doing over the festive period is reinstalling some laptops. While it's usually a slightly tedious job, something Microsoft have done to the Windows Installer of late has made picking the Windows version you want harder than it should be. So I'm leaving myself a note for next time I crash into this problem... &lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I needed to install Windows on a shiny new laptop. It had been bought with Windows Home, because there was no "I don't need to buy a new O/S" option in the shop and I already own a Windows 10 Pro license that I wanted to use on it. So it arrived with the usual bloatware installed on Home and needed wiping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I grabbed a USB Stick, downloaded the &lt;a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10"&gt;Windows Media Creation tool&lt;/a&gt; and made myself a bootable Windows 10 install stick. (Yes, I am still &lt;a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.giphy.com/media/STfLOU6iRBRunMciZv/giphy.gif"&gt;actively avoiding Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; for the moment) And then I went through the usualy dance of rebooting, failing to boot from USB, realising the machine ships with only "boot from SSD" enabled and fiddling with the BIOS... But after a bit of tedium I got it to boot the installer, and went through the "delete existing disk partitions" dance to clean out all the stuff that had been shipped on the laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft have done a bit of UX optimisation - the installer no longer asks about your license key. In fact it asks more questions about "are you ok with uploading &amp;lt;some bit of data&amp;gt; to Microsoft" than it does about your installation requirements these day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes (and some annoying shouting from Cortana because the laptop's default volume was "high") it went through the install fine. But when it booted up, I noticed that it was running Windows Home. Which was not what I wanted...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's going on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I turns out that if you're installing with &lt;a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface"&gt;UEFI&lt;/a&gt; enabled, the installer now looks into some flash memory in your computer to see if you have a built-in windows key shipped by your &lt;a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer"&gt;OEM&lt;/a&gt;. Since I'd bought the laptop with Windows Home installed, that's what was in this memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the installer was happily assuming that was the key I wanted to use for my install, and not giving me an option to change the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see what (if any) key you have stored &lt;a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;using this viewer tool&lt;/a&gt; but be aware that as I'm witing this, Windows' built-in virus protection really doesn't seem to like it. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as Microsoft might see poking about in this data as dodgy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/12-KeyViewerError.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/img/2022/12-KeyViewerError.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you may choose not to go down that road...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Possible solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having spent an hour or so trawling through google for research, there seem to be two main ways to address this issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can let it install as above, and then use the "change my product key" option in Windows.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This will work, but it can be a bit of a hassle. Windows installs some different things for Pro compared to Home, and changing the version afterwards does not fix all of this. So if you want the full Pro experience you will need to go through the process of &lt;a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-refresh-reset-or-restore-your-pc-51391d9a-eb0a-84a7-69e4-c2c1fbceb8dd"&gt;reset Windows back to the fresh-install state&lt;/a&gt; in order to get those extra bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Or you can make use of the installer's ability to pick up extra "unattended install" data from your install media.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is possible to put config on your install device that says "ignore what else you may see, please install Windows Pro". That will make sure all the right files are installed, and you only need to activate the right license key afterwards to get the full Pro experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To my mind, the second option here was the better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to create a text file named &lt;code&gt;EI.cfg&lt;/code&gt; and put it into the &lt;code&gt;sources&lt;/code&gt; folder on the USB disk that the media creator set up for you. There are lots of options you can set here, using an "ini file" style format. But the key ones to get Pro vs Home are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre data-enlighter-theme="droide-text" data-enlighter-language="text" style="width:100%; overflow:scroll;"&gt;[EditionID]
ProfessionalN
[Channel]
Retail
[VL]
0
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also choose other versions of Windows (If you wanted the "N" version of Pro perhaps) &lt;a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1020961/prevent-windows-10-installer-from-using-the-preinstalled-serial-key-without-disa/1608112#1608112" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;using the advice in this Stack Exchange answer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once that file is saved, and you run through the install processs again, you'll get your chosen version. Though it still won't say anything on the screen about which version you're installing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But note that once Windows boots up, the "Activation" page in Settings may be a bit unhappy - it will know that the Home key in your BIOS memory isn't valid for the version you have installed, so you'll need to provide your valid Pro product key to allow Windows to activate. If you log in with a Microsoft Account, and you have a Pro key attached to that it may get picked up automatically. But you might need to manually enter the right key on the Activation settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that done, I was able to get back to the fun process of installing useful stuff onto these laptops, and testing out the new hardware with &lt;a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/846770/DYSMANTLE/"&gt;a bit of festive relaxation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
