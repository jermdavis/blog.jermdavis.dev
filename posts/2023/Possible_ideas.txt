Steam trains vs software
<content>
A few minutes further along the road I live on is <a href="https://kwvr.co.uk/visiting-the-kwvr/stations/oakworth-station/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a train station</a>. It's famous, because it's appeared in a couple of films. But it's a station on a heritage steam railway. The engineer in me is a big fan of classic steam trains, and that got me thinking about parallels between software things and trains the other day...<!--more-->

## Why was the steam engine successful?

[**_Bootstrap better tech on older stuff - just like compilers_**]

## Old doesn't mean useless!

We're in the middst of dramatic change in the world of CMS' and DXPs. Old monolithic systems are on their way out, and modern composable systems are coming in. That does lead to some occasional shouting about how the older systems are "bad" in some way.

But in reality those DXPs were the end result of years of development and tweaking. The market may be moving away from their patterns, but they were the peaks of that technology.

There's a very obvious parallel with steam trains there. The railways also had a period of time where steam was on the way out, and diesel was being phased in. Diesel was the new hotness because you could climb into one of these engines, push a button to start the engine and drive it away. Whereas a steam train needed hours of work to light its fire, oil lots of bits and get pressure in its boiler. At that point steam was more efficient in terms of fuel use, and was much more reliable. But for rail companies, there were still significant advanteges in getting rid of the startup-work steam needed.

There are parallels here. [**_Finish_**]

## Modern trains aren't really composable?

In the days of steam, you could argue that every train was "composable". You had a set of engines, and a set of carriages. For each train being run, the railway company could choose the most appropriate engine and carriages to suit the time of the train and the likely uses of it.

But while modern trains are still made up of engines and carraiges, they're much more likely to be fairly permenantly fixed together. Yes you can swap carriages about, but it involves tools and effort - it's not something that can be done quickly in a station.
