					<p>When I started this blog nearly a decade ago, it was with the goal to see if I could motivate myself to write something about technical stuff on a regular basis. I certainly did not expect that I'd still be doing it 300 posts later. So in honour of that milestone I thought I'd look back at what's gone well here, a bit of what hasn't and how the technical world I'm writing for has changed since then...
						<!--more-->
					</p>
					<h2 id="the-blog-itself">The blog itself</h2>
					<p>So how did I manage to keep up the writing so long? I think it comes down to the old maxim about not setting goals, but changing behaviours. When I started out I had a day a week I wasn't working to do some childcare. The child in question was young enough back then to sleep for an hour or two at lunchtime, which left me with a bit of free time. Making that my "writing time" at the start helped me to form a pattern. And that seemed to be a process that fitted with me. These days I don't have the luxury of "nap time", but having fixed the writing habit in my head, I find I that I can fit in writing around work and other commitments without losing the rhythm.</p>
					<p>Something I learned fairly early on was not to waste my muse when it strikes. The biggest challenge I've had over the time I've been writing has been ensuring I come up with enough ideas for meaningful posts. Early on I seemed to have a lot of inspiration and was able to do a post a week, plus adding in quite a few extra posts when I spotted small things. But as time wore on it got trickier to come up with enough material that I thought was worth posting. To be honest, I'm pretty impressed how long I managed to stick to posting weekly. But as my work has evolved over the years and I've become more "architect" than "developer", the opportunities for getting an idea from a bug I encountered, or a wacky feature a client requested have gotten smaller. Plus the challenge the sort of agency work I do tends to lag behind the technology curve a bit. Hence moving to posting every other week, and not doing much in the way of "in between" posts these days.</p>
					<p>But I am still finding content, broadly through approaching work and my spare-time coding with a "how might this make a worthy post?" approach. I've come to realise I don't have to be the first or only person covering a topic. I just have to bring my perspective to a topic to make it worthwhile posting.</p>
					<h2 id="the-blogging-landscape">The blogging landscape</h2>
					<p>Outside of my approach to the writing evolving over the years, the platform for writing blogging has changed too.</p>
					<p>Partly that's through my choice. I started off on Blogger, but fairly quickly found that I was fighting it's formatting and layout behaviour for code samples. That lead me to Wordpress, which worked well for me for a long time. But eventually their repeated UI redesigns, and move towards a fancy block-based editor made it harder and harder for my writing process to work the way I want to. I grew up on the early text-mode text editing tools on the PC, and I much prefer writing in plain text sprinkled with a bit of Markdown or HTML to create posts. And as they slowly moved all the "just edit the text" links out of the main UI flow, I decided it was time to move.</p>
					<p>But partly what's also changed is the corporate landscape of the internet. Big platforms like Google, Facebook, Medium and the like have tried very hard to attract most the internet's writers into their ecosystems. But at the same time their somewhat anti-competitive practices have become more obvious. So given I like writing code, that was a strong driver for me to move off the big platforms and onto something I had more control of myself.</p>
					<p>Hence the current static site, which I can host anywhere I can put HTML files, and generate using open source code.</p>
					<p>Those big players plus things like Stack Overflow have made blogs "less important" over the decade I've been writing, but it seems worth my effort to continue.</p>
					<p>And maybe blogs will become fashionable again at some point?</p>
					<h2 id="the-sitecore-community">The Sitecore community</h2>
					<p>Writing regularly was the thing that got me noticed outside of the UK user groups, I think. So this blog has been important to my community involvement. It was very gratifying to have long-time MVPs make positive comments when I first went to an event in the US.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Scale of UGs in UK? Apathy / Covid Shrink?</li>
						<li>Makeup of community? US down, east up?</li>
						<li>Makeup of MVPs? More women? Numbers up?</li>
						<li>Where is content? Blogs way less important. Stack Exchange / Slack / Community - spectre of AI [Megan/lunch - recent flouncings out]</li>
						<li>What about ChatGPT - and its effect on MVP / Blog ecosystem? Passable posts - but not creative?</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="sitecore">Sitecore</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Software version - CMS not wildly different</li>
						<li>DMS -&gt; xConnect -&gt; CDP/Personalize</li>
						<li>Composable / Headless</li>
						<li>IaaS -&gt; PaaS -&gt; Containers</li>
						<li>Sitecore Docs SDN -&gt; current</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Next 100? Maybe?</li>
