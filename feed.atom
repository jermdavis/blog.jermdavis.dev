		<content>&lt;p&gt;Having been in Chicago for the last week to attend &lt;a href="https://symposium.sitecore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Symposium&lt;/a&gt; and the MVP summit, I now have a notebook full of interesting observations. While some of that is under NDA and hence all &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Squirrel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Secret Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;, there were a collection of important public announcements which I can report. The key product and technical take-aways from the conferece are pretty important for customers and partners. So here's my summary: &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Usually with these blog posts, I find a problem, I fight with it for a bit, and then I solve the problem. But this post has been sitting half-written in my publishing queue since May (!) this year, and I have entirely failed to solve this issue. So I'm admitting defeat, and publishing this anyway because maybe one of you knows the answer. Or at least it might serve as a warning...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue is that I've been working through some really odd and annoying Solr issues which only manifest in Docker on one laptop. I'm really not sure if these are issues that others might see, or if this is a problem that's entirely down to this laptop's setup. But they're definitely a problem... &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I was hacking up an app as a personal project recently, and decided to try out the latest preview (Number 7) of ASP.Net Core for .Net 7. I happened to be deploying this project to a server which had never run ASP.Net Core before, and that deployment left me scratching my head for some time. So in case this issue hits others, here's what happened to me:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;One thing we don't seem to be short of these days is options for deploying Solr. I've had to do a bit of thinking about this recently, as I draw up plans for a work project. So I figured I'd write a bit of it down because if I'm having to explain it to people, then chances are there are plenty of others out there in Internet Land who are finding themselves having to think about these issues too: &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;For me at least, Symposium is going to be very interesting this year. The move to composable, the first big public event discussing the reality of XM Cloud and the new Sitecore Search product will all generate a lot of interesting content. Plus, with this being the first in-person event since the whole COVID business, I'm expecting quite a buzz this year. Since the first version of the agenda for the sessions was published last week, I've been doing a bit of thinking about what I want to watch in amongst all the great content. So here are some thoughts on the key breakout sessions I'd like to attend. Other than the one that I'm presenting, of course...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges you often deal with using software that's under active development, is that as you take the lastest updates you can find that they subtly change (or break) the behaviour of the tool - affecting stuff that used to work for you. I had a classic example of this recently with this blog. An update to the &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Statiq&lt;/a&gt; engine fixed something in the core library code and created a subtle issue for my website. Since the docs for Statiq don't make this obvious, here's some information for anyone else finding this problem:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;If you're part of the Sitecore Partner or MVP community then you probably watched some of the content from their &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tzikakis/status/1546854414937374720" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Global Sales Kick-off&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; recently. They talked about product roadmap and strategy stuff for the coming year, especially the new &lt;a href="https://www.sitecore.com/company/news-events/press-releases/2022/07/sitecore-experience-manager-cloud-now-available" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;XM Cloud&lt;/a&gt; product. But something else which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daveof" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dave O'Flanagan&lt;/a&gt; called out in his session is of interest to us in the community too: Sitecore's new internal demo portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to spin up a demo instance of Sitecore has been a common challenge for me over the time I've worked with the product. There have been various ways to do this - some very manual, and some involving a bit more automation. Different organisations and people all had their own approaches to how best to do this - but it's now being looked at centrally. I was lucky enough to get a sneak-peak of their new approach to this problem. And now it's been launched it seemed like something worth writing up, to make more Partners and MVPs aware of the tools at their disposal.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
