		<content>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when I want to explore the filesystem of a Sitecore container, it's pretty easy. I can use Visual Studio's container browser. But that only works when a container is running - and if it's based on a job image this may be a very brief window - too brief to find and explore the file in question. So what can I do? &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;A while back &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2021/peeking-into-search-queries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;I wrote a post about how you could extract the raw Solr query from Sitecore's ContentSearch APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Usually the queries hid behind LINQ operations, but there are times where having the raw text can be helpful - sometimes Sitecore's API doesn't support the operations you need. That work was done under Sitecore v10.0, but having tried to repeat it under v10.2, I discover it no longer works. There have been some changes under the surface of ContentSearch which require a different approach. So if you need to do this under v10.2, here's how:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

And (to me at least) one of the most interesting changes is that the server-side event model for the CMS has been extended with Webhooks. What does that mean, and how can you make use of them? Well since I was lucky enough to get my hands on the "MVP Preview" of this release a couple of weeks back, I've had a chance to do some digging. Read on to find out...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

While some of that is under NDA and hence all &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_Squirrel" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Secret Squirrel&lt;/a&gt;, there were a collection of important public announcements which I can report. The key product and technical take-aways from the conferece are pretty important for customers and partners. So here's my summary: &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Usually with these blog posts, I find a problem, I fight with it for a bit, and then I solve the problem. But this post has been sitting half-written in my publishing queue since May (!) this year, and I have entirely failed to solve this issue. So I'm admitting defeat, and publishing this anyway because maybe one of you knows the answer. Or at least it might serve as a warning...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My issue is that I've been working through some really odd and annoying Solr issues which only manifest in Docker on one laptop. I'm really not sure if these are issues that others might see, or if this is a problem that's entirely down to this laptop's setup. But they're definitely a problem... &lt;/p&gt;</content>
