		<content>&lt;p&gt;As you might guess from someone who's been writing a blog for a decade, text adventures were something I really liked back in the day. I spent a lot of time on classic Infocom games like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;.

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who's been doing Sitecore DXP for a while will be fairly comfortable with Solr and how search works under the Content Search APIs. But if you're moving to the newer SaaS products then you're not working with that any more. And getting started with Sitecore's SaaS Search product does involve learning a few changed concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four quick things they tell you that you might not have thought too much about, but you need to remember to help avoid project surprises...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;A while back, work moved from having a traditional domain-joined laptops and an on-site Domain Controller for our Active Directory to the more modern SaaS model of cloud domain. Mostly this doesn't matter at all to employees as they work. But I bumped into one place where I do need to do something different because of this: setting explict disk permissions. So as a reminder to myself for next time, here's how to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;A common but not-fun issue for working developers is when you do some work, test it locally, submit a PR and then find that it blows up on someone else's computer.
