		<content>&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting announcements from &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2022/symposium-2022#connectivity-between-composable-tools-sitecore-connect" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;last year's Symposium&lt;/a&gt; was Sitecore's approach to how we might join up our composable applications. They announced that they were working on "Sitecore Connect" at this event, but didn't really get into detail of what it would be outside of "we're re-badging Workato". So what is that, and what does it suggest we might get out of Connect in the future? Read on, for an attempt at working that out...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I've been migrating a big chunk of .Net 4 code to .Net 7 recently. One of the few large changes I had to make was to replace some boilerplate generation that used T4 Templates with a Source Generator. (As T4 isn't entirely supported in latest .Net) But these work very differently, so that change involved a good chunk of work. But I messed this up in a way that caused a subtle bug. And while I may well get to writing about Source Generators later, that silly bug is also worth writing up. Even if it's just to remind me not to make the same mistake in the future...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;A requirement which comes up every so often is that external systems need to know about changes to content that lives in Sitecore. As with most technical problems, there are a variety of ways that you can solve a problem like this, and they all have different pros and cons. One of my colleagues has been working on a project like this recently, and the approach required there meant we bumped up against an interesting configuration challenge. If you're writing code that monitors content changes you might need to think about this:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when I want to explore the filesystem of a Sitecore container, it's pretty easy. I can use Visual Studio's container browser. But that only works when a container is running - and if it's based on a job image this may be a very brief window - too brief to find and explore the file in question. So what can I do? &lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;A while back &lt;a href="https://blog.jermdavis.dev/posts/2021/peeking-into-search-queries" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;I wrote a post about how you could extract the raw Solr query from Sitecore's ContentSearch APIs&lt;/a&gt;. Usually the queries hid behind LINQ operations, but there are times where having the raw text can be helpful - sometimes Sitecore's API doesn't support the operations you need. That work was done under Sitecore v10.0, but having tried to repeat it under v10.2, I discover it no longer works. There have been some changes under the surface of ContentSearch which require a different approach. So if you need to do this under v10.2, here's how:&lt;/p&gt;</content>
