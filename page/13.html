<p>I wasn't at <a href="http://www.sugcon.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SUGCON</a> this year, but I followed the event on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23sugcon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and have read a few of the write-ups that have been posted since the event. A popular topic this year has been applying machine learning to Sitecore in the quest for ever cleverer personalised experiences. It's fascinating stuff to read about, and I'm sure it has great potential for the future, but what I didn't see much discussion of was the possible down-sides of using "AI" for these tasks rather than people making choices. So allow me to <a href="https://images.asadart.com/sources/com/halloweenexpress/images/imagecache/242-375-cswo112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put on some comedy horns</a> and play devil's advocate for a bit...<!--more->--></p>

<p>If you spend your life working with software, you can't help but collect a few stories of issues that defied your understanding – and I came across a great example with Sitecore recently. I haven't managed to decide if this is an issue that can happen to others, or whether it was completely specific to the setup of this particular site. But since I got few useful results from Google when I was trying to solve this, I figure it's worth writing about it just in case someone else sees a similar problem in the future...</p>

It worked fine for most of his testing, but raised an exception in some circumstances.

<p>The one thing that is true of every aspect of IT is that it is always changing. And that change means that things you were confident of in the past may no longer hold true.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this while sitting in the pub with some developers recently, talking about querying for items by path in Sitecore. The debate about the best way to do this raged, but a common thread of the debate was that it is often said that the fastest way to find a set of items you needed is via a ContentSearch index. That assumptions has its roots in the time when most sites were using Lucene to run queries, and for queries with more complex matching rules. But does that hold true here?</p>

<p>A lot of projects I've worked on over the years have had requirements about consuming content feed data over the internet. Whether they're Sitecore projects or not, "we need to display the contents of an RSS Feed" is a fairly common requirement. It should be nice and simple. There are standards and schemas for feed formats like RSS and Atom, so the data should be predictable and easy to handle...</p>
<p>Unfortunately, back in the real world, this rarely seems to be the case. I still regularly come across feeds which don't match the schema, or in extreme cases feeds that aren't even well formed. Sadly <a href="https://cdn.meme.am/cache/instances/folder861/53395861.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some people still seem to think that string concatenation is the way to build XML</a>...</p>
<p>So what are your choices for handling feed data, and how can you try and get around bad-data challenges?</p>

<p>One of the big things in IT security in recent times has been the successful attacks black-hats have launched against the infrastructure of cryptography. As we all come to rely on encrypted communications more and more, the vulnerabilities in old ciphers have become more of a problem to us developers and administrators. Vulnerabilities like <a href="https://drownattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drown</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poodle</a> are just two examples of a trend which means we all now have to worry about how our crypto is configured before we allow the internet to see a server.</p>
<p>But whenever you tie down security more tightly you risk causing problems when software relies on the thing you've just disabled...</p>
<p>I spent some time recently investigating why certain aspects of the <a href="http://www.coveo.com/en/solutions/coveo-for-sitecore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coveo for Sitecore</a> search framework were broken on a client's server, and the answer ended up being directly related to crypto security.
