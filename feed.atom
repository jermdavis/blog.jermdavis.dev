		<content>&lt;p&gt;Symposium is over for another year. I have &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; recovered from the jet-lag now and I've wrestled my inbox into submission at work. So it's time to write up my thoughts on the conference. I took about 35 pages of notes over the course of the week, plus countless photos of slides. So from all that what stuck out as interesting to me?&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I quite often clone Sitecore's Docker Examples repo and spin up a Sitecore instance to experiment with. It's a quick way to create a disposable site which I can easily configure and deploy little bits of test code to. But recently I did this and noticed some odd warnings. So here's what happened and why, to help you avoid the same issue...&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;I was having a chat recently about alternatives to &lt;a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; if you needed to send HTTP requests to arbitrary web endpoints. I mentioned using Visual Studio's support for &lt;code&gt;.http&lt;/code&gt; files for this during that discussion, and then found myself trying it out for some work too. But it seems there's a couple of tricky little bugs hiding in here, which tripped me up when I tried to set up a call to one of Sitecore's XM Cloud GraphQL endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

		<content>&lt;p&gt;As developers we often need to move data between SQL Server instances. Some of the time database backups are fine for this, because you want to move everything. But on occasion what you need is a SQL script which can insert some rows of data you had on another server for you. And when I find myself needing this feature, I also find myself having to google how to do it. So to help my memory, here's how to generate scripts for your data:&lt;/p&gt;</content>

This is a pure static site, hosted on Github Pages, so there's no Solr or Algolia here. Just some clever JavaScript (&lt;a href="https://lunr.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lunr.js&lt;/a&gt;) acting on data generated by &lt;a href="https://www.statiq.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Statiq&lt;/a&gt;.

Both the site generator I'm using these days, and the simple editor tool I hacked together to suit my writing process. I realised recently that one of those rough edges that remained in the process was the need to manually commit my writing to source control, so I wondered what it might take to wire that into my editing tool...&lt;/p&gt;</content>
