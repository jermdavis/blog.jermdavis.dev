		<content>&lt;p&gt;The world model from the previous post is all well and good, but the player needs to be able to interact with it. What do we need to add to allow that? Well we need an abstraction for the things the game is going to allow the player to do.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

I spent a lot of time on classic Infocom games like &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1g84m0sXpnNCv84GpN2PLZG/the-game-30th-anniversary-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;.

		<content>&lt;p&gt;Anyone who's been doing Sitecore DXP for a while will be fairly comfortable with Solr and how search works under the Content Search APIs. But if you're moving to the newer SaaS products then you're not working with that any more. And getting started with Sitecore's SaaS Search product does involve learning a few changed concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are four quick things they tell you that you might not have thought too much about, but you need to remember to help avoid project surprises...&lt;/p&gt;</content>
